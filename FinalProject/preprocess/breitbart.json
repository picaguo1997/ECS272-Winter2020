I knew back in January when the first reports came out of China that they\u2019d been hiding it for weeks. I know that they\u2019ve had a bioweapons program in place in China for decades. I know that they have only one level 4 laboratory in China, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, a city with \u2026 probably 15 million people.\u201d", "LISTEN:", "", "Mosher continued, \u201cBut then we have new evidence. At an emergency meeting in Beijing held on the 14th of this month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u2014 I might call him dictator Xi, except Michael Bloomberg would object, but he is the dictator \u2014 he held a meeting and he spoke about the need to set up a system to prevent epidemics in the future by increasing lab safety. He said laboratory safety is a national security issue.\u201d", "Mosher went on, \u201cNow, if that isn\u2019t clear enough, the next day, the very next day, [the] Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive, and its title, it\u2019s a little bit long, but pay attention to this, is \u2018instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.\u2019 Wait a minute, wait a minute, \u2018instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in labs that handle viruses like the novel coronavirus\u2019 \u2014 the one virus causing the epidemic \u2014 and you mean to suggest, China, that maybe your lab\u2019s biosecurity management wasn\u2019t very good and that this virus actually escaped from the lab in Wuhan, and now you\u2019re playing catch up after the cat is out of the bag, after the genie is out of the bottle, after the horse has left the barn?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what it certainly sounds like to me,\u201d assessed Mosher. \u201cIt sounds like they have a real problem keeping dangerous pathogens and test tubes where they belong and I\u2019ll tell you this: we know that there have been many, many leaks from China\u2019s biotechnology labs in the past their bioresearch labs are leaky.\u201d", "Mosher remarked, \u201cIn fact, in Beijing a few years ago, they leaked the SARS virus \u2014 that deadly SARS virus. SARS is sudden acute respiratory syndrome. [SARS] killed ten percent of the people that it was communicated to \u2014 at least twice out of a lab in Beijing a few years ago. We know they have a problem with containment of these dangerous pathogens.\u201d", "Mosher stated, \u201cWe know they\u2019re working on them, tinkering with them, doing genetic engineering on them. In fact, this Ministry of Science and Technology now wants to strengthen biosecurity management, [and] has been funding research on coronaviruses for the last ten years.

How did it get out of the lab? Well, this is interesting, too, because you might think that the most likely scenario is a researcher in the lab was careless and got some of the virus on his clothing or actually got infected with the disease then went out into public and infected the public, but there\u2019s another vector. And the other vector is this: that sometimes in China researchers who are buying expensive lab animals, after they get done researching the lab animals, maybe infecting them with coronavirus, they then, if the lab animals are still alive, they then take them to make a little extra money and sell them at the local fresh meat market where they are slaughtered and wind up in someone\u2019s stomach.\u201d", "Mosher added, \u201cNow that\u2019s hard to believe, but it does happen. There are researchers in prison in China today who have done that and who have been caught. The fact is Chinese Communist Party officials try to monetize anything they\u2019re in control of, and if you give a Chinese party official a bunch of free lab animals, he\u2019s going to use them for his research and then, in some cases, instead of cremating them like they\u2019re supposed to, they then turn around and sell them on the meat market.\u201d", "\u201cThere was a meeting in Beijing by the head of the National Health Service of China a few weeks ago, and he instructed [health workers] in all the provinces, cities, and towns of China that the first priority was politics, the second priority was safety, and the third priority was curing the sick,\u201d recalled Mosher.", "China\u2019s quarantine measures are \u201cmore like the guillotine,\u201d determined Mosher. \u201cIt\u2019s more like just amputation, amputating these people out of society, so they won\u2019t infect others.\u201d", "Mosher praised the Trump administration\u2019s policies towards addressing the coronavirus threat.", "\u201cWe took action faster than almost any country,\u201d he said, highlighting President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban foreigners who had recently traveled to China from entering the U.S. He added, \u201cPresident Trump set up a task force with the leading epidemiologists, the leading virologists, [and] the leading figures in the field and he\u2019s giving them all the resources that they need.\u201d", "Mosher concluded, \u201cIf there\u2019s an administration that is capable of handling this kind of crisis, it\u2019s the Trump administration.\u201d", "Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.", "Follow Robert Kraychik\u00a0on\u00a0Twitter."], "headline": "Steven Mosher: 'Most Likely Explanation' for Coronavirus Is Wuhan Bioweapons Lab", "time-stamp": "02/26/2020, 01:22:15", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/02/25/steven-mosher-most-likely-explanation-for-coronavirus-is-wuhan-bioweapons-lab/", "journal": "Breitbart"}, {"content": ["ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The government urged health officials around the country Friday to get ready now in case there are outbreaks of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in the U.S. this summer.", "A Zika epidemic has been sweeping through Latin America and the Caribbean, and officials think it\u2019s likely some small clusters of Zika will occur in the U.S. when mosquito numbers boom.", "At a \u201cZika Summit\u201d on Friday, experts prodded some 300 state and local officials gathered at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters to make Zika response plans now.", "When West Nile virus \u2013 transmitted by a different mosquito \u2013 moved through the U.S. about 15 years ago, health officials were caught flat-footed, noted Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.", "\u201cThis is an opportunity to get ahead of the curve,\u201d he told the summit\u2019s attendees.", "The Zika virus causes only a mild and brief illness, at worst, in most people.

It has contributed to the great increase of agricultural productivity, while sparing countless humanity from a host of diseases, most notably perhaps, scrub typhus and malaria.

For example, the company\u2019s report is titled \u2018The Duqu Bet.\u2019 Bet is the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet.\u201d", "Based on their own experience battling the infection in their systems, Kaspersky technicians describe this strain of Duqu as an instrument too sophisticated, expensive, and delicate for rogue hackers to develop and deploy.", "Notably, they are convinced creating this enhanced version of Duqu would have required access to the original source code \u2013 which, in turn, is believed by Kaspersky to share some electronic DNA with the Stuxnet virus, a joint U.S.-Israeli project, as Business Insider\u00a0reports. Chris Weber of Casaba Security is quoted by BI describing Duqu 2.0 as an \u201cextremely advanced malware platform with delivery mechanisms on part with Stuxnet.\u201d Weber went on to more pithily describe the new Duqu strain as \u201cbad-ass.\u201d", "It is not clear exactly what the Duqu spyware did while it was in the hotel systems. \u201cAmong the possibilities, the researchers say, the intruders might have been able to eavesdrop on conversations and steal electronic files by commandeering the hotel systems that connect to computers, phones, elevators and alarms, allowing them to turn them on and off at will to collect information,\u201d the WSJ writes.", "In fact, the virus deposits separate modules to complete these and other tasks, so it is possible that whoever was controlling the software could have done them all. Duqu 2.0 is also good at hiding itself, vacating systems without leaving intrusion footprints, and installing little back doors it can use to return to compromised systems in the future.", "Everyone else involved is very gingerly stepping around the question of where that virus came from. The Israelis acknowledge keeping the Iranians under surveillance, deny spying on the United States, and chose not to comment on\u00a0the Duqu situation. U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies are quick to explain how\u00a0they\u2019re not jumping to the conclusions everyone knows they already hold.", "The management of potentially affected hotels did not wish to discuss the possibility of hacker penetration, citing internal privacy policies.
