[{"content": ["Sven Henrich is founder and lead market strategist at NorthmanTrader. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.", "Recent history suggests that when a disease outbreak occurs, it will soon be contained, the economic impact will be minor and the markets will eventually ignore the whole thing. The SARS virus, for example, broke out in China in 2003 and killed 774 people, but it was largely contained and the S&P 500 rose by more than 20% that year.", "But things are looking to be much different with the coronavirus. The global economy remains fragile and an extended outbreak could tip the current aging business cycle into a global recession, right when US markets are seeing some of their highest valuations in history. ", "The coronavirus is still spreading rapidly and has now reached over 25 countries, with the number of infections reaching over 28,000 and causing 560 fatalities (as of February 6). For investors to get the all clear, these numbers will need to show significant slowing.", "Investors have so far taken the coronavirus outbreak in stride, with only a minor drop at first and then a rally on containment hopes. There hasn't been any real damage done to markets yet. But there are several factors to consider that suggest the risk to global markets may currently be masked mainly due to large liquidity injections by central banks, such as the People's Bank of China and the US Federal Reserve.", "Bad timing for China's economy", "China is now the second-largest global economy. And what happens to its economy has global repercussions. ", "Before the outbreak, China reported its weakest annual growth in 29 years, in part due to its trade war with the United States, mounting debt, slowing birth rates, aging population and deflation. China cannot afford another major setback like the coronavirus.", "Yet, with a number of businesses including Nike, Adidas, Starbucks and Apple, temporarily closing stores due to empty streets and close to two dozen airlines cutting off service to the mainland as a result of the coronavirus, it appears China's economy is being dealt another blow.   ", "Bad timing for the US economy, too", "During the SARS virus in 2003, the US economy had just come out of a recession. Markets had bottomed in 2002, and 2003 saw an economic recovery bringing about massive new growth. SARS didn't really matter to markets. ", "Now it's different. Last summer, the US economy officially entered its longest growth expansion in history and many fear that an economy this late in its growth cycle can't handle a larger outside shock. Recessions typically occur on a regular basis and are useful to refresh growth and weed out inefficiencies and excess in the market. But constant central bank intervention has bolstered our economic growth and allowed for excesses and inefficiencies to keep building up in the economy.", "Already we had a yield curve scare last summer, and we have seen three rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and a Treasury bills buying program that have been credited with easing recession fears.", "In recent weeks, despite record highs in the markets and hopes for a rebound in economic growth in 2020, the bond market has not confirmed the reflation trade. The yield curve has once again flattened and is at risk of inverting again, repeating a pattern last seen just before the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession.", "The stock market was already overvalued", "The recent market rally has produced some of the largest market valuations in history. US markets have (until last week) been trading at a total market valuation of 157% compared to gross domestic product, or GDP \u2014 a record figure, higher than numbers seen during the 2000 market bubble. ", "There is no history that suggests that such high market valuations, that are so disconnected from the underlying size of the economy, are sustainable. In 2000, when market capitalization to GDP reached nearly 150%, the subsequent recession resulted in a valuation reversion to 75% market cap to GDP. In 2007, the market cap to GDP peak reached 110% before reverting to 57% during the following recession. Historically speaking, this is an extremely overvalued market. ", "This outbreak only adds uncertainty to the global economic outlook. While the coronavirus may play out like the SARS crisis, the risk to investors may be much higher than markets are letting on at this time. ", "While markets rallied this week on hopes that the virus will be contained in short order, the Word Health Organization threw cold water on prospects of a quick fix announcing there's no known cure at this stage. Uncertainty remains. This is not over.

But working together we can catch the majority of them,\" Messonnier said in a call to reporters Monday.", "Where are people in quarantine staying?", "The CDC said it is working with state and local partners to identify locations where eligible travelers coming in through the 11 designated US airports could potentially be quarantined. Those could include military bases, hotels or other sites, Messonnier said.", "Others evacuated from Wuhan by the State Department are staying in military housing, the CDC said.", "Two charter flights carrying US citizens from Wuhan landed Wednesday at Travis Air Force Base in California. One will remain there, while the other is expected to continue on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, a US official with knowledge of the matter told CNN.", "Later this week, two more flights are due to land in the United States, the CDC said.

So depending on their insurance coverage, a person could be responsible for some or all of those costs.", "During the public comment period for HHS' latest rule on quarantine regulations, which went into effect in 2017, a flight attendant union argued that the federal government should pay for any medical costs incurred by flight attendants in quarantine. But HHS rejected the suggestion.", "\"... While it is not HHS/CDC's intent to unduly burden individuals with the costs of their own isolation or quarantine, payment for expenses will be made consistent with constitutional and ethical obligations to provide for the basic necessities, e.g., food, medical treatment, for those subject to such public health orders,\" the department said in its final rule.", "For those who are deemed unable to afford health insurance, the government will pick up the tab but Hodge said it might outsource some of those costs to programs like Medicaid when possible.", "Evans told CNN that the evacuees at March Air Reserve Base will be billed for their evacuation flight. He doesn't know what other evacuees are being charged, but he said that his own bill is for $1,100. And once the quarantine is up, he said everyone will have to pay their own way to their final destination.

If it does result in a death, the person would be subject to a fine of up to $250,000, a year in jail or both.", "When was the last time a federal quarantine happened?", "Before concerns about the novel coronavirus, the last time US officials issued a federal quarantine order was in the 1960s for smallpox evaluation, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told reporters Friday.", "The CDC defines quarantine as separating and restricting the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they get sick.", "It's more common for the agency to issue federal isolation orders, which separate people who have been infected with a contagious disease from those who have not been infected. The CDC said it issues about one to two orders for quarantine, isolation or conditional release a year.", "Are quarantines effective? ", "In general, confining people who have or could be suspected to have a disease like coronavirus to one place is effective to prevent it from being transmitted to others, Hodge said.", "But how quarantine orders are executed make a big difference, he said. Compelling people to stay in a facility away from their home for period as long as two weeks could have unintended consequences. People could potentially lie about or misrepresent their degree of exposure to a disease to avoid that kind of situation, Hodge said.", "\"The potential implementation of federal, heavy-handed quarantine can be problematic and can backfire,\" he said.", "Allowing people to be contained within their own homes would be a better solution, Hodge said, and would make people more willing to comply.", "But CDC officials said on Friday that once people are educated on why the federal government believes quarantine is necessary, they mostly cooperate.", "\"We understand that this is a difficult situation for them.

", "\"I don't think airport temperature checks have any major effect on stopping or even slowing down transmission,\" said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. \"We just don't have any good data to support that.\"  ", "Since mid-January, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been employing temperature checks at selected airports, at first on people flying in from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, and now on all passengers who've been anywhere in mainland China in the past 14 days.", "The temperature checks are part of an overall screening effort that includes giving passengers cards telling them to watch out for fever, cough and trouble breathing, all symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease, also called COVID-19.", "\"Finding sick people who are at risk for COVID-19, alerting asymptomatic travelers who may develop COVID-19 symptoms after arrival, and rapidly responding to any suspect COVID-19 illness, we can most effectively protect the health and safety of the American public,\" said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.   ", "Some experts say it's that card -- a simple card listing symptoms in English and Chinese -- that holds the key to detecting coronavirus infection -- not a thermometer.  ", "Temperature checks for US coronavirus cases  ", "CNN reviewed statements by local, state and federal health officials, and emailed and spoke with officials, to determine how many people eventually diagnosed with coronavirus went through airport temperature checks.   ", "Ten passengers flew into US airports on commercial airliners and were later diagnosed with coronavirus.  ", "CNN's investigation shows that four of those 10 passengers went through temperature checks and were found not to have a fever or any other symptoms of the virus. Two of those passengers flew into Los Angeles International Airport and two flew into San Francisco International Airport.  ", "Previously, a CDC spokesperson had told CNN that two of the passengers were symptomatic during flight, but the spokesperson later said they were asymptomatic while flying. ", "Another 4 out of the 10 passengers were not screened because they flew into airports that did not have screening at the time. Those cases are in Illinois, Washington state, Massachusetts and California. ", "It's unclear whether the final two passengers went through temperature checks because health officials at the CDC and in Wisconsin and Arizona refused to say when asked by CNN. ", "When human nature gets in the way ", "There's another reason why airport temperature checks don't always work: human nature. ", "Let's say someone's on a long-haul flight to the United States and starts to have a scratchy throat or feel tired or achy. The passenger might attribute those feelings to jet lag or dry air on the plane. Maybe they would take a pain relief medicine such as Advil or Tylenol and try to forget about it.  ", "\"That's just human nature,\" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.  ", "When the person lands, they might not have a fever because, in addition to relieving pain, Advil and Tylenol also treat fever.  ", "\"That's why for this type of screening, there's no evidence it has any measurable impact on the ultimate course of the outbreak,\" Osterholm said.  ", "What does work ", "While airport temperature checks haven't caught any coronavirus cases, the information cards have helped catch US cases of the virus at least twice.  ", "On January 24, a man flew into San Francisco \"and was found to be totally healthy and asymptomatic,\" according to Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, interim health officer for San Benito County, California.  ", "As part of the screening routine, the passenger was given a card -- technically called a Travel Health Alert Notice -- that explained he should take his temperature twice a day and call his local health department if he developed a fever or cough or had difficulty breathing.  ", "The next day, the man had symptoms.  ", "\"So he looked back at [the card] and said, 'Oh, we need to stay at home, per this information, and contact our local health department,' which they did. So it's good that they were screened, and he abided by that information, so that's good,\" Fenstersheib said at a press conference.  ", "In the other case, a man flew from Wuhan to the Los Angeles airport in mid-January, where he was screened and did not have a fever or other symptoms of coronavirus. He was given the traveler alert card and flew immediately to Mexico.  ", "After a few days in Mexico, the man had a family emergency in China and flew back to the Los Angeles airport with plans to immediately board a flight to Wuhan. But at the Los Angeles airport he felt ill, and while wearing a mask, he presented himself to health officials there.  ", "\"He had the card and he remembered,\" a health official told CNN.   ", "US travel restrictions to stop the spread of coronavirus  ", "The CDC has taken other steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus.  ", "On February 3, the CDC announced that most foreign nationals who've been in China in the past 14 days will be barred from entering the United States.  ", "According to the new policy, US citizens, lawful permanent residents and their families who have been in China in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States only through one of the 11 airports that have health screenings.  ", "Those 11 airports include the San Francisco and Los Angeles airports as well as John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York; Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Washington Dulles International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.  ", "After screening, passengers who are found to be symptomatic for coronavirus will receive further medical evaluation.  ", "Passengers who are asymptomatic are handled differently depending on their travel history. If they've been in Hubei province in the past 14 days, they're not allowed to continue their travels, and must be quarantined at a location near the airport for 14 days.  ", "If they've been elsewhere in mainland China, they can continue their travels and are asked to stay home as much as possible and monitor their health.  ", "The lesson of Ebola  ", "On September 19, 2014, Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian citizen, flew to the US to visit family. By official accounts, he left Liberia a healthy man.  ", "Days later, he fell ill and went to an emergency room in Dallas, Texas. Doctors there missed his Ebola infection, and later he was admitted to that hospital, where he subsequently infected two nurses and then died.  ", "Five years later, that's exactly the scenario the CDC wants to avoid with the new coronavirus.  ", "To that end, the CDC has put out guidance to doctors on how to handle possible coronavirus infections, and to hospitals on infection control for the new virus.  ", "\"They're doing a great job at this,\" said Osterholm, the epidemiologist in Minnesota.  ", "These are the measures -- information to travelers, doctors and hospitals -- that can help stop the outbreak, Osterholm said, and less so the temperature screening.  ", "\"But everybody around the world is doing it, so I guess if we didn't do it, we would look like we were being derelict in our duty,\" he said.

As of Friday, 11 people have died in or near Kirkland and we still don't know the full breadth of the threat or the response needed due to the botched testing rollout and lack of resources.  ", "Many people I care about are sick but none know if it's coronavirus or something more typical. I'm sad, scared and worried.  Worried about my kids, worried about my family, my own health, and my community. And I'm mad -- deep in my cells angry.  Just days ago at a rally, President Donald Trump said: \"This is their [Democrats] new hoax,\"  unhelpfully politicizing a public health crisis that is endangering Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, and people of all parties alike. ", "This is no hoax.  We need help.", "People in Kirkland have been trying to prepare as much as possible on their own, while also trying not to over purchase at stores so neighbors have supplies too.  Listening to advice from public health experts, many have been stocking up on two weeks of food and supplies. And now there isn't an antibacterial wipe or bottle of Purell to be found in local stores (experts say washing your hands with soap and water for the full \"Happy Birthday\" song twice -- or 20 seconds -- is effective). In many stores, stocks are low for non-perishable goods too, even toilet paper, and last I looked dried black beans were often also back ordered in top online stories.   ", "But we can't solve this on our own with cabinets full of non-perishable goods. Medical resources, including testing kits, and smart public health policies, including access to paid sick days, are urgently overdo. ", "As the death toll climbs here, few people in Kirkland know whether they should go to work or not if they have even a runny nose or sore throat. While the testing criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now say anyone in the United States can get a test if their doctor orders one, here in Kirkland, and in the King County area including Seattle, testing for the coronavirus isn't currently available unless you've traveled outside the United States to a select group of specific countries or been in direct contact with someone who has tested positive. ", "To confirm this, because news reports and statements from politicians have varied, I called the King County Department of Public Health coronavirus line Thursday evening, sat on hold for 35 minutes and spoke with someone who told me they still don't have tests available outside that narrow criteria and don't know when they will have them.", "All of this is in contrast to what we're hearing from the federal government: on Monday, the FDA stepped forward to say it would orchestrate the production of one million coronavirus tests by this Friday, working with public and private ventures; the possibility of this feat happening was immediately questioned by experts. And, while on Tuesday Vice President Mike Pence said, \"Any American can be tested\" for coronavirus, local doctors here in Kirkland say tests are not yet available.", "Of course, it's hard to take any of the promises that Trump or Pence make relating to the coronavirus and public health seriously at this point when no significant increase in tests are to be found here at the center of the epidemic, when Trump has called the coronavirus outbreak a \"hoax,\" when Trump  has rolled back public health programs, and when he has also demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the coronavirus vaccine process and timeline despite being corrected by public health experts numerous times. ", "Facing this extreme inaction by the federal government, Washington state is now working to implement commercial tests, but as of Wednesday there wasn't a timeline on when those tests would be available or how many. ", "Even with the testing criteria, the Trump administration created a botched system that for too long caused a backlog because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day in our entire country. Contrast that to South Korea where people can get a drive-up test. ", "For our nation as a whole, and for Kirkland in particular, the current narrow testing criteria and resources are wholly insufficient: research is showing that the coronavirus has likely been spreading undetected in our community for up to six weeks, meaning many people here likely have the illness -- including in its mild form -- and just haven't been able to be tested yet, so have been inadvertently spreading it farther as they go about their daily lives.  To be clear, people here are rightly concerned and needing to be tested even if they haven't been in the Life Care Center in Kirkland, where the majority of fatalities have occurred, because \"community transmission,\" which is when cases arise in the community without a specific source, is beyond the doors of that particular facility here. In fact scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle estimate the number of people who are getting the virus here is quickly doubling every six days. But despite this community transmission, there is not yet any community testing. ", "We have a true crisis in the United States. Everyone gets sick in normal times, so without testing no one can say for sure what they have:  coronavirus that should result in their being quarantined to protect our neighbors and the rest of our nation, or a normal winter cold or illness. ", "In this pressure cooker of stress, there is also pressure to go to work.  While in Washington State most workers can accrue paid sick days, tens of millions of people, including the majority of low wage workers across the nation cannot.  To follow doctor's orders and stay home when sick, or to be quarantined when the coronavirus strikes, or to be there when a child's school is closed due to the outbreak, everyone needs access to paid sick days. And when facing a choice between paying rent and taking an unpaid day off, most people who are struggling to make ends meet have little choice but to work sick. ", "The National Partnership for Women & Families recently highlighted the dire situation: more than a quarter of private sector workers, and 70% of low wage workers, don't have access to a single paid sick day in our nation, with Latinx and black workers put at the most risk.  Hidden in these statistics is the fact that the majority of food service and childcare workers can't even earn paid sick days. And that adds up to more than 32 million working people in the United States who don't have a single paid sick day available to put to use, even to follow public health experts' orders in a coronavirus outbreak.   ", "We've long had a slow, silent moving national emergency when it comes to any virus.  It's irresponsible to deny access to paid sick days this year or any year. Congress must pass the Healthy Families Act, which guarantees seven paid sick days to workers at businesses with 15 or more employees and seven job-protected unpaid sick days for workers in smaller businesses. It's also fiscally irresponsible not to pass this policy. Studies show that a lack of paid sick days causes \"presenteeism,\" which means there is lost productivity and increased spread of illness in the workplace because people have to work sick, costing our national economy an estimated $160 billion annually, or about $234 billion when adjusted for inflation. President Trump must sign it into law immediately so we can protect our families, economy and country. ", "Want proof that passing paid sick days helps? According to a 2017 report, during a flu wave, there was up to a 40% drop in flu rates in cities and states that have passed paid sick days. Over 40 US locations -- cities, counties and states -- have already passed paid sick days, so the momentum exists to pass a federal paid sick day policy in Congress because access to earned sick days shouldn't depend on your zip code. Illness doesn't hesitate to cross from one zip code to another.  ", "Right now, we are in nothing short of an emergency situation: we have an unprecedented outbreak of a virus and a botched testing kit response by the Trump administration, which has also recently proposed cutting funding to the CDC and NIH in its FY 2021 budget, disbanded the National Security Council's global pandemic response team and has yet to fill the vacancy, and ended overseas programs to stem pandemics. At the same time, we also lack domestic public health policies that most other countries have. For instance, over 140 other countries have a guaranteed minimum number of paid sick days and we do not.  ", "To address a critical crisis and to keep our economy moving into the future, we urgently need not only paid sick days, but also full access to affordable health care and childcare, and paid family/medical leave in our nation. We need federal funds quickly moved to support testing, scientists, medical professionals, states, localities, businesses and families in the fight against the coronavirus.  And the Trump administration not only needs to fix the coronavirus testing protocol rapidly (and not just say they are fixing it) and push the CDC to release data so public health experts can take appropriate action, they also need to work with Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act. ", "It's time, Mr. President, to take the coronavirus seriously before even more American lives are sacrificed to the delusion that this will just go away. As a resident of Kirkland, Washington, I can assure you that the coronavirus is not a hoax.  ", "And as the executive director of MomsRising, an organization of over a million people with members in every state in our nation, I can assure you that the moms of America know this is an emergency and are also demanding immediate action. The federal government needs to act quickly and get in front of this before what is happening in my community happens in countless cities and towns across America.", ""], "headline": "I live in Kirkland, epicenter of the US outbreak.

Community spread could be reasonably mild or very severe.", "You might be urged to work from home", "The CDC has posted guidance on its website to help businesses and employers make decisions on work-from-home policies or flexible sick leave if there is significant spread of the coronavirus across the country.", "Such guidance also includes how to respond if an employee gets sick.", "The 2017 document noted that \"social distancing measures that reduce face-to-face contact in workplaces might include offering telework and remote meeting options. Flexible sick leave policies should be implemented to encourage workers to stay home if needed.\"", "Also according to the document, \"CDC recommends environmental surface cleaning measures in all settings, including homes, schools, and workplaces, to remove influenza viruses from frequently touched surfaces and objects.\"", "Yet overall, \"what community spread looks like in the United States will vary greatly community by community. It might vary by time, it might vary by place,\" Shah said. ", "\"Although we believe, according to the US CDC, that community spread is likely in the United States, the magnitude of that possibility as well as how it actually plays out, that will vary greatly between Washington state, Florida, Maine and any other state,\" he said, adding because of that, \"there will not be a one-size-fits-all approach here.\"", "First responders may have to act", "With the spread of disease, health care systems could become taxed with high rates of hospitalizations and deaths -- and it could impact other critical infrastructure, too, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services and the transportation industry, according to the CDC.", "Many state health departments are already in talks with emergency medical technicians, paramedics, firefighters and other first responders to plan how to handle sick patients while remaining healthy themselves in case the virus spreads through the community. Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against the coronavirus and no medications have been approved, yet, to treat it.", "\"What this looks like, again, will vary greatly community by community, city by city, state by state,\" Shah said.", "The CDC has produced more than 23 guidance documents on infection control, hospital preparedness, personal protective equipment supplies and clinical evaluation and management to help first responders and health systems prepare for the possible spread of the disease.

The first is to urge everyone to keep themselves and their families as healthy as possible. Exercise, eat a good diet, get a lot of sleep, wash your hands, do everything you can to stay healthy right now. The other thing we're recommending is that folks stay informed,\" Shah said.", "\"We really want to urge everyone to avoid dubious sources of information and stick with trusted sources like their state health departments or the US CDC,\" he said. \"We're in a situation where fear and misinformation can spread more quickly than this virus.\"", "Shah also suggests staying up to date on the CDC's coronavirus travel warnings and alerts.

In these events, a procedure such as bronchoscopy -- where a doctor inserts a tube into the patient's lungs -- can result in many infections.

The virus might well be impossible to contain -- just as the common cold and influenza can't be stopped, but the health and societal impacts can be blunted.", "China's extraordinary efforts to stop the spread of the virus, even if unsuccessful, may slow its spread and improve China and the world's ability to limit the harm the virus causes.", "What do we need to do now?", "We must protect health care workers and others who care for sick people. This is done through a hierarchy of controls: source, engineering, administrative and personal.", "Source controls include encouraging patients who are only mildly ill to not expose others; requiring all people who are ill to wear face masks; limiting hospital attendance by visitors who may be infectious; ensuring that ill health care workers don't work; and minimizing the number -- and ensuring the safety of -- risky procedures such as bronchoscopy and sputum induction, by performing them only in isolation rooms.", "Engineering controls include putting partitions in triage areas, making sure potentially contaminated air is not recirculated and surfaces are cleaned meticulously, and implementing additional precautions for suspected cases.", "Administrative controls include asking all patients if they have symptoms and taking their temperatures; requiring those with cough or fever to wear a face mask, and isolating them from others at least by several feet until they are more thoroughly assessed. It's especially important to recognize all potentially infectious patients quickly and to implement strict infection control procedures and early in all areas of all health care facilities.", "Personal controls include hand washing and respiratory hygiene.

A decline on that scale could mean $62 billion in lost growth.", "China can ill afford that kind of hit. Growth last year was already the country's weakest in nearly three decades, as China contended with rising debt and the fallout from its trade war with the United States. ", "The coronavirus, which first appeared in the central city of Wuhan, has already killed more than 200 people and infected more people than the SARS outbreak in 2003. A disease of this magnitude wasn't even on China's radar. Before the outbreak, the government was more worried that social unrest could be its \"black swan\" problem \u2014 an improbable but chaotic event officials feared could be spurred by rising unemployment. ", "Now Beijing is scrambling to stop the virus from cratering its economy. The ruling Communist Party recently put Premier Li Keqiang in charge of virus control.

", "Zhang, who works at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote this week that he expects economic growth to slump by a percentage point to 5% in the first quarter, assuming the epidemic lasts until the end of March. He described that as his most optimistic scenario, but didn't give a specific forecast should the outbreak last even longer.", "The government could cut taxes and boost spending on public healthcare and employment training, Zhang said. He also expects local governments to spend more on infrastructure. By boosting economic activity and creating jobs, he added, cities can offset any weakness in private investment in real estate and manufacturing.", "The central bank is also likely to deliver more interest rate cuts to stabilize the economy, Zhang said. Altogether, he said such measures could help growth rebound next quarter and push annual GDP growth to around 5.7%. While that's lower than last year's 6.1% growth, it would be in line with many analyst expectations.", "Others take a more pessimistic view. ", "Analysts at Nomura believe growth could drop by two percentage points or more in the first quarter. The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, wrote Friday that the outbreak could shave two percentage points off GDP growth this quarter, citing industry insiders.

Tesla (TSLA) has been forced to close its new Shanghai-built factory temporarily. And Apple (AAPL) has lost production from suppliers in Wuhan. The longer term impact on both companies is much less clear.", "Other sectors might have more to lose right now. Tourism \u2014 a multibillion-dollar industry during the Lunar New Year \u2014 has been decimated as the government quarantines major population centers and people avoid traveling for fear of becoming infected. Major travel companies, hotels and airlines have offered refunds through most of February, while some airlines have suspended services to and from China. ", "Holiday celebrations have been canceled and major tourism spots have been closed off. China's massive box office will also likely take a hit after several blockbuster movies set to release during the holiday season were pulled.", "Zhang and other analysts suggested that the fallout could even be more serious than after SARS, the respiratory disease that caused China's economic growth to briefly plunge before rebounding nearly two decades ago. ", "The spread of the coronavirus threatens to cause job losses and push consumer prices higher, compounding economic woes that already exist. ", "The employment market is already under stress this year. Industries that traditionally create a lot of jobs, like the technology sector, have been hurt by the economic slowdown. The coronavirus outbreak will make things worse, according to Zhang.", "China's 290 million migrant workers are among those most exposed to a slump. Many of them travel from rural areas to the cities to take on construction and manufacturing jobs or perform low paying but vital work, such as waiting tables in restaurants, delivering packages or acting as janitors.", "But because many factories and businesses remain shut down, millions of those workers might find it hard to land a job after the extended Lunar New Year holiday ends. More than 10 million migrant workers from Hubei province alone might also face discrimination from employers fearful that they may spread the virus. ", "Zhang warned that China's unemployment rate \u2014 already a concern for officials \u2014 could reach a record high in the coming months. The rate traditionally has hovered around 4% or 5%.", "He added the virus could also make consumer goods more expensive. Budgets are already tight because of rising debt, and a pork crisis brought on by the outbreak of African swine fever among China's pigs last year has caused the price of meat to skyrocket. Now vegetable prices have risen as people rush to buy basic necessities during the virus outbreak, according to the state news agency Xinhua. ", "Other challenges", "Dealing with the disease will make some of China's other problems that much tougher to solve \u2014 including its tricky trade relationship with the United States. ", "As part of a truce reached earlier in January, Beijing agreed to buy $200 billion worth of US products in the next two years. Analysts have already said that shrinking domestic demand in China will make it tough for the country to hit those targets. If the virus weakens the country's buying power even more, those goals could move even further out of reach. ", "Substantial tariffs totaling hundreds of billions of dollars also remain in place on many Chinese goods. And Washington has made it clear that those will remain a form of leverage as the two sides negotiate the next phase of their agreement.", "Even so, at least one analyst finds it unlikely that the trade war will escalate just because China is \"temporarily\" unable to honor its trade commitments.
