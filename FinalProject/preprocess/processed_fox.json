Its teachings revolve largely around the Book of Revelation, a chapter of the New Testament known mostly for its apocalyptic foreshadowing.", "Health and city officials say the woman eyed as a potential transmitter at the church had contact with some 1,160 people, both at the church and at a restaurant and a hospital where she was treated for injuries from a car accident. That raised fears that South Korea \u2014 which before Wednesday had recorded just 31 cases of the virus \u2014 should brace for a further surge.", "\u201cI hope South Korea will do everything to contain this outbreak at this early stage,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization.", "Usually bustling downtown streets of Daegu were nearly deserted Friday as people wearing face masks lined up at clinics seeking testing.

In the capital of Seoul, major downtown rallies were banned, and fears of the virus led many to avoid shops and restaurants and instead eat at home and order necessities online. Buses and subways were full of mask-clad commuters.", "The first three cases in the country\u2019s 600,000-member military also sprung up on separate bases Friday, bringing added concern. A sailor on Jeju Island and an army officer in North Chungcheong province both tested positive. Both had made recent visits to Daegu, officials said.

Originating in Wuhan in Central China, there are now cases of this virus infection in at least 29 countries, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is either human-to-human transmission or SARS-2 deaths in Europe (Italy), the Middle East (Iran), and several Asian countries, especially South Korea.", "Although the WHO has not yet declared SARS-2 a global pandemic, we seem to be inching in that direction, and it is increasingly likely that this could become an important new respiratory virus infection in the United States.\u00a0Therefore, a key issue before the American people is our top priorities if this virus gains a \u201cfoothold\u201d in the U.S., as suggested by our CDC Director, Dr. Robert Redfield.\u00a0 ", "Lesson learned from Wuhan \u2013 protect our healthcare workers", "One of the most troubling aspects of SARS-2 in Wuhan and Central China\u00a0is how their frontline healthcare workers were exposed to the virus. It has been estimated that over 1,700 Chinese healthcare workers have been infected, including six who died.\u00a0Included among the reasons for the high rates of infection among this group is a shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE), but also because some SARS-2 patients present without classic symptoms of a respiratory virus infection, such as cough or shortness of breath. For example, it was just reported in the Journal of the American Association\u00a0(JAMA) that at least 10 health care workers at a university hospital in Wuhan were infected after coming into contact with a patient who was admitted to the surgical ward and presented with abdominal symptoms. The study also found widespread transmission of the SARS-2 virus in the hospital. Our nation\u2019s hospitals must prepare now for a similar situation happening here.", "SOME HUMAN CORONAVIRUSES CAN LIVE ON SURFACES FOR 9 DAYS, STUDY FINDS", "Protect our older Americans", "Some of the highest fatality rates of SARS-2 now occur among individuals over the age of 60 and those with underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. When the first SARS virus hit China in 2003, there was a serious outbreak with deaths in a Hong Kong nursing facility. We should anticipate this possibility.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER", "Get vaccinated!\u00a0", "I have highlighted previously how if SARS-2 becomes a significant public health problem in the US in the coming weeks, it will coincide with our influenza epidemic, which has been especially severe this year and might last until late in the spring.\u00a0In addition, measles could return in 2020 just as it did in 2019. Back when measles occurred regularly in the U.S., it often peaked in late winter and early spring. We simply cannot ask our healthcare workers and state and local public health agencies to fight a triple epidemic of SARS-2, measles, and influenza over the coming weeks. It is therefore imperative that Americans get their families vaccinated against flu and measles.", "State and local health agencies\u00a0", "If SARS-2 transmission becomes significant, many Americans believe the CDC will lead our nation\u2019s response locally. The truth is that the CDC typically takes on an important advisory role, so that it would most likely fall to state and local public health departments to respond and manage these outbreaks. We have some outstanding state, county, city and local health departments, for instance our Harris County and Houston city health departments where I live and work. But we learned during the 2016 Zika outbreaks in Texas and Florida, that there can be tremendous variability in the staffing and expertise among different county and local health departments. Therefore, we\u2019ll need to be ready to assist health departments lacking depth and breadth in their capacity for managing serious infectious disease epidemics.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "Should President Trump appoint a \u201cSARS Czar?\u201d", "The President has put in place an outstanding team through our Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) to fight this epidemic. I\u2019ve met DHHS Secretary Azar previously and find him to be smart, committed and pragmatic. He has assembled an outstanding team of top public health physicians, including Drs. Robert Redfield and Nancy Messonnier at CDC. Previously, I also worked closely with Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir when he led then-Governor Perry\u2019s infectious disease task force to combat Ebola virus infection after it appeared in Dallas, Texas. And of course, Dr. Anthony Fauci is still at the helm at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The point is that this is an \u201cA-team\u201d and Americans should feel very good about its ability to respond to SARS-2. However, we have also seen how serious and widespread epidemics can sometimes require the help of agencies outside of the health sector. The most obvious example occurred in 2014 when Ebola virus infection was decimating the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leon. We ultimately needed to send in the 101st Army Airborne Division\u00a0-- the \u201cScreaming Eagles\u201d -- to lead Operation United Assistance in order to provide a working health system to administer care and treatment. In addition, Ron Klain was appointed as \u201cEbola Czar\u201d because of the complexity of our Ebola response, which involved numerous agencies of the federal government. He did an excellent job, and if SARS-2 becomes a significant public health threat in the U.S., our nation may require a similar coordinator to navigate activities across multiple federal agencies.", "New Technologies", "Finally, we are going to require improved biotechnologies to fight this epidemic. One of the problems faced by Chinese physicians was the lack of a sensitive and point-of-care diagnostic that could detect this virus in the early course of a patient\u2019s illness. We\u2019ll need such a diagnostic in order to give our nation\u2019s healthcare workers the best chance to make good decisions on which patients require isolation during clinic visits or visits to hospital emergency rooms. We\u2019ll need new antiviral drugs for severely ill patients, and we\u2019ll need preventive vaccines, such as the ones we\u2019re developing through support from the NIAID, NIH and other agencies. Through both the NIH and the creation of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), we have a running start on shaping these technologies. The U.S. hosts the finest research universities and institutes the world has ever seen, and I\u2019m confident they will be up to the daunting task of accelerating new SARS-2 diagnostics, drugs and

that we educate hospitals on the fact that technology already exists to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, and this technology is tested and proven.\u201d", "For example, Lee said, when it comes to monitoring transmission through the air it is known that viruses are sensitive to ultraviolet light treatment, with coronavirus being no exception.", "\u201cTechnology exists today that can bring

Medical staff reserve these for the sickest patients and specially trained staff care for these patients to ensure everyone is protected.\u201d", "It\u2019s not hospitals and medical facilities that can help prepare for a potential outbreak either, as there are steps Americans can take to avoid illness in their everyday lives.

That experience will undoubtedly serve him well as he works to get a variety of federal agencies all rowing in the same direction to respond to the new coronavirus.", "Unfortunately, the Democrats have repeatedly demonstrated that they have no interest in working with the Trump administration to protect Americans from the coronavirus.
