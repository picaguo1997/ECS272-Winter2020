Wild-animal markets remain common in much of the world.", "Once a virus jumps into humans, population density becomes a factor in turning what might potentially be a small eruption of illnesses into an epidemic. A crowded city such as Wuhan, which has a population on the same order of magnitude as New York or London, creates conditions for person-to-person transmission.", "Because these events have remained unpredictable, the public health responses have tended to be a game of catch-up, with communities desperately trying to contain the spread of the virus through quarantines, disease surveillance and rigorous hygiene practices. Eventually a vaccine can provide broad protection, but development takes many months or years.", "Viruses have differing levels of contagiousness and virulence (the degree to which they make someone sick). The reproduction rate \u2014 how many people a sick person is likely to infect, on average \u2014 helps determine how widely it will spread.

If it makes a person very sick and symptomatic \u2014 coughing, sneezing, throwing up, etc. \u2014 that can enhance the spread of the virus. But a sick person tends to be immobile and isolated and in contact with fewer people. A milder disease can spread more easily.

anxiety and questions: How lethal is the virus? How can it be avoided? Is travel, especially to China, suddenly risky?", "Here is what we know so far.", "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to much more serious diseases, according to the World Health Organization. They can infect both humans and animals. The newly emergent strain in China is related to two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The new virus hasn\u2019t been named yet; it\u2019s referred to as \u201ca novel coronavirus.\u201d", "In rare cases, coronaviruses can spread from animals, such as camels and bats, to humans. (Household pets are not a threat.) The new virus is believed to have originated from a live animal market in Wuhan. But now it\u2019s clear, health authorities say, that the virus is spreading from person to person \u2014 likely through coughing and sneezing or touching an infected surface and then the mouth, nose or eyes, or coming into contact with contaminated fecal matter.", "Symptoms range from fever, muscle aches, dry cough, runny nose and shortness of breath to much more severe problems such as pneumonia, kidney failure and acute respiratory syndrome. The elderly, young and people with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk of developing acute problems, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ", "So far, the virus appears more serious than the common cold but less dangerous than SARS, public health experts have said. It does not appear to be anywhere near as\u00a0deadly as Ebola, which is harder\u00a0to transmit because it requires direct contact with an infected person\u2019s blood or bodily fluids.", "Antibiotics don\u2019t work on viruses. There\u2019s no medication for the new coronavirus, though the National Institutes of Health said human vaccine trials could begin within three months. Currently, health-care professionals are focusing on providing \u201csupportive care,\u201d including ensuring patients get plenty of liquids and oxygen.", "The situation is fluid but getting worse.", "The CDC has urged travelers to avoid Wuhan. Several other Chinese cities also are essentially on lockdown. Even places that aren\u2019t quarantined are experiencing disruptions and closures that could affect where travelers go and how they get around. For example, Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland have been shuttered, as have many theaters and temples.", "Would-be travelers can stay abreast of developments by checking the CDC website and monitoring alerts issued by the State Department and U.S. embassies.", "Beijing authorities are restricting the movements of their own people. Officials said all inter-province bus services to and from Beijing would be halted in an effort to contain the outbreak, according to local news reports. In addition, officials are suspending domestic and overseas Chinese group tours, state media reported.", "Elsewhere in Asia, cases of infection appear isolated. Nevertheless, more vulnerable travelers, including those who have health issues or are older, should be cleared by a medical professional before departing.", "Yes, if the insurance was purchased with the \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d benefit. This optional upgrade for the policy usually has several restrictions, but if the traveler meets the criteria, he or she can recover up to 75\u00a0percent of their trip costs. People with standard travel insurance who cancel because of fear of contracting the virus will have to absorb the losses, however. When traveling outside the United States, travelers should be sure they have travel medical insurance that will cover hospital costs if they fall ill while abroad or need to be taken back to the United States.", "Some airlines are. Cathay Pacific passengers who reserved a ticket on or before Jan.\u00a021 can rebook, reroute their flight or receive a refund without penalty for travel through March\u00a031. Air China is also waiving change and cancellation fees for tickets issued by Jan.\u00a031 for travel by March\u00a029. Other airlines that are loosening their rules include United, China Eastern, China Southern and Hainan. Some carriers, however, are taking a wait-and-see approach.", "Some hotels also are making it easier to rejigger plans: Hilton, Accor, InterContinental Hotels and Hyatt are easing restrictions, and not just on Wuhan hotels. The waiver covers changes and cancellations at properties throughout China, for travel through early February. To qualify, the booking must have occurred directly through the hotel; otherwise, the third-party agent should be contacted.", "Policies vary among tour operators and should be checked.", "A large number of airports around the world have established enhanced screening procedures for passengers arriving from Wuhan, and a few countries, including India, are testing passengers arriving from any destination in China. South Korea\u2019s Incheon International Airport is employing ear thermometers. In Japan, arriving passengers must fill out health forms. Australia is distributing pamphlets.", "In the United States, the CDC and Customs and Border Protection are overseeing the process at five international airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta and Chicago. Screening for symptoms and elevated temperatures may add a few minutes to the arrival process. Passengers who test positive for coronavirus will be quarantined for further testing by the CDC.", "The CDC recommends that everyone get a flu shot and other required vaccinations for their destinations.

In China, where 5,974 people are infected, 132 have died through Tuesday. That is a high rate, but far less than the fatality rate of SARS and MERS. And countries like the United States that quickly began screening travelers, isolating sick people and tracing their contacts have just a handful of cases. There have been no fatalities outside China.", "Public health officials said Tuesday that they are grappling with a long list of unknowns that will determine how successful they are in limiting the toll of the widening outbreak.

China has shared information showing when cases were reported, but not when people became ill.", "Researchers also want to know more about the incubation period, currently estimated at two to 14 days, and how severe most cases are.", "The virus\u2019s fatality rate is just over two percent, if figures posted by the Chinese government are accurate. That is considerably lower than death rates from the respiratory coronaviruses that caused SARS, which killed nearly 10 percent of people infected, and MERS, which killed about 35 percent.", "Some experts are encouraged that no case outside China seems to be severe. and that no fatalities have been recorded outside China so far.", "Others cautioned that the current death rate may mean little because the most severe cases in an epidemic like this one often emerge early, when sick people present themselves to health care providers, then become fewer as public health measures are instituted and medical care is strengthened.", "Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted in an interview that the virus may have been spreading unnoticed for weeks in Wuhan before it emerged into public view.", "If many people had mild symptoms, it would have been easy to miss them, and that made it harder to put control measures in place, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.", "Experts also are unsure whether asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus.

And asymptomatic patients never drive more than a small percentage of infections in epidemics such as this one, Fauci said.", "\u201cEven if there some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory-borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person.\u201d", "Frieden and others emphasized that even if officials cannot stop transmission, they can still reduce the number of people who get infected, as well as those who get very sick and die. A critical measure, for example, is beefing up readiness by training health-care workers in hospitals to prevent the spread of illness.", "At the moment, U.S. officials are isolating coronavirus patients in the hospital. But that may not be practical if there are many more cases. During SARS, highly infectious patients known as \u201csuper spreaders\u201d were responsible for the virus\u2019s rapid spread in health-care facilities.", "It makes more sense to isolate someone with a mild coronavirus illness at home, said Nuzzo, the Hopkins expert. \u201cIf somebody only has a fever and runny nose, is there a need to freak out?\u201d she said.", "Sun and Bernstein reported from Washington.

Yet another is being put together at facilities in San Diego and Houston, with projections that it could be tested in people by summer.", "To scientists, the work to create a vaccine against the new coronavirus is advancing with a speed they could barely have imagined a decade ago. At the same time, it\u2019s not even close to quick enough to contain the spreading infection \u2014 and in many ways, the outbreak will test the capacity of science to react in real time to a new and unknown \u201cpathogen X\u201d that takes the world by surprise.", "\u201cTraditional vaccine development efforts have usually taken decades, not months,\u201d said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, which hopes to have a vaccine in human testing by April. \u201cThis is, first, a response to this new virus, but it\u2019s also a drill for pathogen X \u2026 [to] press the system, to see how rapidly we can go.\u201d", "When a mysterious new illness emerges and public alarm is at its peak, there\u2019s a race to develop a way to prevent or treat the disease. But by the time a promising candidate is ready, it\u2019s often too late to be helpful against the outbreak that triggered the rush. Public interest, funding and the urgency that drove the early vaccine development can quickly taper.", "\u201cWe were getting candidate vaccines, the epidemics would die down, and they\u2019d get put back on the shelf,\u201d said Jacqueline Shea, chief scientific officer of Inovio, a biotech company that has been developing vaccines for Zika, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome.", "That\u2019s what happened with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to the dismay of Peter Jay Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. Eight years ago, he and his co-director, Maria Elena Bottazzi, won federal funding to create a vaccine against SARS, a coronavirus that emerged in 2002 and infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. By 2016, they had manufactured enough of the potential vaccine to get through toxicology tests and human safety trials.", "But the team tried and failed to win various grants to bring their experimental vaccine through further testing. They say about $2 million could have funded essential and time-consuming toxicology studies and ready it for phase 1 trials \u2014 the technical term for the first-in-humans studies that typically determine the dosing and safety of a drug. Although the threat of SARS has receded, it was becoming increasingly clear that coronaviruses, long thought to cause mild illness, were able to cause serious pandemics.", "When the new coronavirus genome sequence was posted to an online genetic databank in early January, Hotez immediately saw the close similarity to SARS and realized the samples sitting in storage had the potential to defend against the new virus.", "\u201cHad we been able to secure the investment, we could have done all the phase 1 trials. We could have potentially been ready to vaccinate in China, now,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cThis is the problem with the whole vaccine infrastructure \u2014 it\u2019s reactive, not anticipatory enough. \u2018Oh, SARS is gone now, let\u2019s move on.\u2019\u201d", "Scientists are unraveling the Chinese coronavirus with unprecedented speed and openness", "What the scientific response to the new coronavirus has shown so far is how the first step in the process \u2014 designing and even beginning to manufacture the vaccine \u2014 can happen nearly overnight, thanks to the emergence of new technologies.", "Scientists at the National Institutes of Health were strategizing with a Massachusetts biotech company, Moderna, over the winter holiday break about collaborating to build a vaccine for the virus. As soon as the genome of the virus was posted online, NIH designed the piece of the vaccine that should trigger the immune system to recognize and disable the virus. NIH sent its design to Moderna, which could integrate it into its virus platform and rapidly scale up manufacturing. NIH hopes to have the vaccine in the first safety trials by April.", "At Inovio, a biotech company headquartered outside Philadelphia, a team began working on designing a vaccine hours after the sequence appeared, Shea said. The company farmed out production of one piece of its vaccine to a contract laboratory in Houston and is making the other component at its facility in San Diego. The company is gearing up for the lab and animal tests that will be necessary before safety trials in people.", "Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has also jumped into the vaccine effort and estimates it will be eight to 12 months before its candidate is ready for testing in people. Many countries are also working on different approaches, in parallel.", "\u201cThe actual technical feat of making a vaccine against this virus is probably not going to be that hard,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cThe problem is you can\u2019t avoid or even compress the timelines very much for safety testing.\u201d", "That means scientists are flooded with public interest in their vaccine efforts right now and must temper their excitement with the reality that there will be a months-long wait, at minimum, for a vaccine that\u2019s ready for its first tests in people.", "\u201cWhat is the value of a vaccine if development takes a year in the context of the current situation, which seems to be moving very rapidly? The value of a vaccine is we don\u2019t actually know what the trajectory of the epidemic could be,\u201d said Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global alliance that is funding the Inovio and Moderna efforts and another vaccine being created by researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia.", "For example, if the outbreak is still raging after initial safety tests, it is possible experimental vaccines could be used to protect people on the front lines of treating the disease or in emergency situations before they are approved for the general population, as happened with Ebola. When Ebola devastated West Africa in 2014, a vaccine was not ready. But when the virus resurfaced in 2019 in Congo, more than 200,000 people were vaccinated.", "If the infections have begun to subside by the time vaccines are through the first round of safety testing, getting a vaccine approved would still be useful in case the virus flares again \u2014 but showing it is safe for healthy people in the general population will take time and continued effort.", "In the meantime, researchers are also looking at ways of quickly repurposing existing antiviral drugs to see whether any might work against the coronavirus. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson, said the company has donated 100 boxes of an HIV medication, Prezcobix, to clinicians in Shanghai to see whether it showed any efficacy against the illness. Purdue University researchers hope to test experimental drugs that were initially developed to fight SARS. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, researchers have been gearing up to test remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug that has shown promise against other coronaviruses but failed against Ebola.", "But every step takes time. Even having the right laboratory tests, ingredients and animal models of the disease are crucial and time-consuming steps. Laboratories have been waiting for the viral genome to be synthesized by companies and are anxious to get samples of the actual virus.", "A decade after SARS, another coronavirus emerged that caused Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Many say the coronavirus in China is a lesson that this family of viruses will continue to cross from animals into humans and cause potential pandemics. That means scientists would like to be prepared, with vaccine platforms that can be readily adapted to new infections and antiviral drugs that work broadly for multiple diseases.", "\u201cEmerging viruses, they\u2019re a moving target. They come, and they go, and sometimes they come and they don\u2019t go. But it\u2019s impossible to predict the trajectory of an emerging virus,\u201d said Timothy Sheahan, assistant professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina. \u201cSo one way we\u2019re trying to maximize the utility of a given antiviral drug is to develop broad-spectrum antivirals.

Many of the hospitalized cases were people with underlying health conditions, with many mild cases detected only using a test developed for the virus. The mild infections seem not to transmit to others, he said, \u201cso they are dead-ends for the virus.\u201d", "As a result, MERS tends to cause small, self-limiting clusters of cases. MERS infections are still happening because people are still being exposed to infected camels, he said.", "In China, authorities have not yet identified the source of the virus. It is almost certain to be a mammal, because coronaviruses are mainly mammalian viruses, Rambaut said.", "Chinese authorities have closed the wild-animal market in Wuhan. If that is the source, the outbreak will probably go away, he said. But the virus will still be out there in the animals somewhere, so it is important to find the direct source.", "Authorities also need to create a fast and sensitive test that can detect the new virus in clinical samples. \u201cOnce you know what you are looking for, it is much easier to find it,\u201d Rambaut said.", "Over the past week, people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports. The WHO is not recommending any specific measures for travelers, and is advising against any restriction on travel or trade with China based on the information available.", "China\u2019s transport officials told reporters Thursday that they will take measures, such as disinfecting transportation hubs, to prevent the spread of the illness during the Lunar New Year period later this month, when more than 400\u00a0million Chinese are expected to travel.", "Sun reported from Washington.", "Specter of possible new virus emerging from central China raises alarms across Asia", "None of these 195 countries \u2014 the U.S. included \u2014 is fully prepared for a pandemic", "A pandemic is killing pigs around the world, and U.S. pork producers fear they could be hit next", "Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world", "Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"], "content-summary": " None of these 195 countries \u2014 the U.S. included \u2014 is fully prepared for a pandemic As surveillance improves, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.
