An infected person rides in an elevator, touching buttons both outside and inside the elevator or maybe sneezing during the ride. When that person leaves, microscopic droplets containing the virus stay behind. The next people who press the same buttons or touch a surface pick up the virus on their hands, then scratch their noses or rub their eyes.", "\u201cEyes, nose, mouth \u2014 all those mucous membranes are the portal into the body for a virus like Covid-19 or SARS,\u201d said Mary-Louise McLaws, professor of epidemiology, health care infection and infectious diseases control at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.", "Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus\n      newsletter.\n    ", "\u201cI was in a conference yesterday watching people, and in just about two minutes I counted a dozen times that I saw someone touching mucous membranes,\u201d Dr. McLaws said. \u201cIt is a very common practice.

While medical students attended a lecture, the researchers filmed them and counted the number of times they touched any part of their faces. Over the course of an hour, students touched their faces, on average, 23 times. Nearly half of the touches were to the eyes, nose or mouth \u2014 what infectious disease researchers call \u201cthe T-zone.\u201d", "Other studies of primary care doctors, people doing office work, and students riding a simulated rail car have all found similar rates of touching the T-zone.", "\u201cI was really surprised,\u201d Dr. McLaws said. \u201cBy touching your mucous membranes, you\u2019re giving a virus 11 opportunities every hour if you\u2019ve touched something infectious.\u201d", "The risk of picking up a virus by hand-to-face contact depends on a number of factors, including the type of virus, whether the surface was nonporous, how long ago the virus was left behind, how much time the infected person spent in the area and the temperature and humidity levels.", "The World Health Organization notes that while we don\u2019t know how long the new coronavirus survives on surfaces, it seems to behave like other coronaviruses \u2014 which is unsettling news. A recent study from the Journal of Hospital Infection found that similar coronaviruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for as long as nine days under ideal conditions. That\u2019s far longer than the flu virus, which typically can survive under ideal conditions only up to 24 hours on hard surfaces. Public Health England says that, based on studies of other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, \u201cthe risk of picking up a live virus from a contaminated surface\u201d under real-life conditions \u201cis likely to be reduced significantly after 72 hours.\u201d", "In general, a virus will survive the longest on nonporous surfaces made of metal and plastics \u2014 including door knobs, counters and railings. A virus will die sooner on fabrics or tissues. Once on your hand, a virus begins to lose potency, but it will probably live long enough for you to touch your face. Although more study is needed of coronavirus, in one study of rhinovirus, which causes the common cold, a small dose of virus was placed on a participant\u2019s finger. An hour later, about 40 percent of the virus was still viable. After three hours, 16 percent could still be detected.", "We also know from the 2003 epidemic of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus than the one currently spreading, that the virus was often transmitted from surface contact. In one Hong Kong hotel, an infected doctor who checked into his room on the ninth floor before going to the hospital for treatment left a trail of virus that infected at least seven people who also had rooms on the ninth floor, who then went on to spread the disease elsewhere. The doctor, who died from the infection, was later identified as a \u201csuper spreader\u201d linked to about 4,000 cases of SARS that occurred during the epidemic.", "The good news is that frequent hand washing can make a meaningful difference in lowering your risk. During the SARS epidemic, hand-washing reduced the risk of transmission by 30 to 50 percent. But after washing your hands, you must still be mindful about face touching, Dr. Sawyer said.", "\u201cYour hands are only clean until the next surface you touch,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you reach for the door knob or hand railing, you\u2019ve recontaminated your hand with something. If you touch your mucous membranes, then you could inoculate yourself inadvertently with that organism. If there is one behavior change that could prevent infection, it\u2019s do not touch your T-zone.\u201d", "But it\u2019s not easy to stop face touching. In fact, many people say that the more they think about it, the more their eyes twitch and their nose itches. A number of memes have emerged on social media from people who say that ever since the warnings about coronavirus, they can\u2019t stop touching their own faces.", "Only humans and a few primates (gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees) are known to touch their faces with little or no awareness of the habit.

German researchers analyzed the brain\u2019s electrical activity before and after spontaneous face touching, and their findings suggested that we touch our faces as a way to relieve stress and manage our emotions.", "To break the face-touching habit, try using a tissue if you need to scratch your nose or rub your eyes. Wearing makeup may reduce face touching, since it may make you more mindful of not smudging it. One study found that women touched their faces far less when they wore makeup. Another solution: Try to identify triggers for face touching, like dry skin or itchy eyes, and use moisturizers or eye drops to treat those conditions so you are less likely to rub or scratch your face.", "It also may help to wear glasses to create a barrier to touching your eyes. Gloves or mittens can also make you more mindful of not touching your face (and can make it more difficult to put your finger in your nose or your eye). Although gloves, too, can become contaminated, viruses don\u2019t live as long on fabric or leather.", "Given that face touching is a long-ingrained habit, it makes sense to remain vigilant about frequent hand washing and wipe down your desk, phones and community surfaces.
