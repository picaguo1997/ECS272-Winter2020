", "China has responded with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities. But has its response gone far enough? And what lessons did it learn from the deadly Sars outbreak in 2003?", "Sars posed a huge challenge to China both as a public health crisis and a political one. ", "The World Health Organization (WHO) was first alerted to reports of severe and unusual cases of pneumonia in the country's south in February 2003. Local officials said more than 300 people had become sick. ", "Despite initial openness, other local government officials appeared to play down the risk or suggest the mystery threat was contained. Analysts who studied the Chinese response said the issue soon disappeared from the spotlight. ", "Investigations later showed the first infections appeared in Guangdong Province in November 2002, but it took months for the scale of China's Sars crisis to be exposed. Physician Jiang Yanyong alerted the international media in April that the Chinese government was drastically understating the Sars threat. ", "Advice was circulated to hospitals and the director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even issued an unprecedented apology over the spread. \"Our medical departments and mass media suffered from poor co-ordination,\" Li Liming told a news conference.", "Combating Sars was complicated because of uncertainties about how it was spreading. The WHO issued its first global alert on 12 March 2003 after a patient hospitalised in Hanoi, Vietnam led to handfuls of medical staff becoming sick. Hong Kong's Department of Health also confirmed outbreaks of respiratory illness among its hospital workers.", "\"This was the first time a coronavirus had come to the attention as a pathogen that could spread around the world like this,\" Prof David Heymann, who led the WHO's infectious disease unit at the time of Sars, told the BBC. \"So in the beginning it wasn't known what it was and nobody really looked for coronaviruses such as they are doing now.\"", "Prof Heymann told the BBC that Chinese authorities appeared to have been much more proactive with the new outbreak, including providing the WHO with information on a regular basis. This week, the WHO's director general praised China's response.", "The lack of transparency over Sars hurt China's standing on the international stage and caused its economic growth to slow.   ", "Health experts, including Prof Heymann, stress transparency as a key factor in preventing the spread of viruses, especially unknown ones. Once proper control measures and infection prevention were implemented, Sars was contained within months.", "This was aided by public health information being shared by the WHO and local governments wherever Sars was a concern. ", "Hong Kong was one of the major hotspots for the virus. People there began to change their routines, with surgical masks becoming the norm in public. Surfaces in public areas with high risks of transmission, like lift buttons, were cleaned hourly and every day the local news carried updated tolls of those infected killed by the virus.", "Helier Cheung, a BBC journalist who grew up in Hong Kong, remembers she and classmates having their temperatures taken daily. Classes were suspended for several days - right in the run-up to exams - and television adverts reminded the public to wash their hands and bleach surfaces. ", "Her experience contrasts with that of another BBC employee who was working at a university in mainland China at the time of Sars. She remembers relying heavily on rumours and access to foreign news outlets when little official information was available. She also remembers misinformation spreading - with bowls of vinegar set on burners in classrooms in the mistaken belief they could disinfect the air.", "\"I do remember being worried, but very poorly informed,\" she said. Information and clarity were sparse even when students were quarantined and her campus later locked down.", "In recent days, Chinese officials have tried to show they are being much more open this time.

Some international scientists have estimated the true number of people impacted by the new coronavirus is far higher than has been publicly confirmed.", "Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute in London, told the BBC he became aware of rumours circulating about a new virus in Wuhan several weeks ago - well before the first cases were confirmed on 31 December. Local officials may have been very nervous to be the ones to raise the alarm, he said.", "\"President Xi Jinping pays a lot more attention to the international image of China than his predecessors, and he has concentrated much more power than his predecessors,\" Mr Tsang said.", "\"Therefore anything that could potentially have a negative impact on the international image of China becomes sensitive.\"", "Chinese social media is also highly regulated and the New York Times reported that the hashtag #WuhanSARS was blocked locally. Police even questioned eight people about spreading \"rumours\" of the virus online, according to reports.", "The Sars outbreak was a catalyst for change in China's medical system, with health spending rising afterwards.", "Health officials used to report infectious diseases by filling in cards by hand and then posting or faxing them to a central office. After Sars, the government created a centralised online system that links up clinics and hospitals across the country and lets them report cases in real time.", "\"China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since Sars, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,\" Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at Sydney's Kirby Institute, told Reuters.", "Gabriel Leung, chair of public health at Hong Kong University, said the timescale of \"recognising, characterising, releasing and reporting information\" had been vastly improved from the time of the Sars outbreak. \"What did take months during the time of Sars is now compressed into a matter of weeks or days,\" he told a news conference earlier this week.", "But not all of the public health reforms suggested after Sars have been implemented.", "In 2006, Zhong Nanshan, the doctor who identified Sars and who is leading the Chinese government's efforts in Wuhan, said it was crucial to clean up China's wildlife markets, which were \"poorly managed and insanitary\" and \"a dangerous source of possible new infections\".", "But reports from Wuhan suggest inter-species transmission is also at the centre of the new outbreak. A market in Wuhan, which was shuttered the day after the first cases were confirmed, is thought to have sold animals including rats, live wolf pups and civets, the last of which have been linked with previous pandemics in the past.", "Typically, traditional use in local delicacies or medicines has hindered efforts to clean-up the animal trade. But with a market again identified as a source of an outbreak, even official media are mobilising appeals against the wildlife trade in response. Propaganda posts telling people #SupportBanningWildAnimalMarkets have been widely shared on Chinese social media.", "Whether the radical measures implemented by China, going beyond even WHO recommendations, are enough to avoid a repeat of Sars remains to be seen. ", "Dr W Ian Lipkin, a US-based epidemiologist who worked on Sars, is among the experts who have cast doubt on whether the travel restrictions from cities, including Wuhan, will be enough to stop the global spread.", "\"The horse is already out of the barn,\" he was quoted by the New York Times as saying.

["The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003.", "There were around 8,100 cases of Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - reported during the eight-month outbreak.", "But nearly 10,000 cases of the new virus have been confirmed, most in China, since it emerged in December. ", "More than 100 cases have been reported outside China, in 22 countries. ", "The number of deaths so far stands at 213 - all in China. In total, 774 people were killed by Sars.", "On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency over the new outbreak.", "The UK on Friday confirmed its first two cases of the virus.", "In another development, the US also declared a public health emergency and said it would bar any foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks from entering the country.", "Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the true total number of cases could be far higher than official figures suggest. Based on mathematical models of the outbreak, experts there say more than 75,000 people may have been infected in the Chinese city of Wuhan alone, where the virus originated. ", "Most cases outside China are in people who have been to Wuhan. But Germany, Japan, Vietnam, the United States, Thailand and South Korea have reported person-to-person cases - patients being infected by people who had travelled to China.", "Wuhan's Communist Party chief said on Friday the city should have taken measures sooner to contain the virus.", "\"If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,\" Ma Guoqiang told state broadcaster CCTV. ", "As governments around the world acted to contain the virus, WHO spokesman Chris Lindmeier warned that closing borders could in fact accelerate its spread, with travellers entering countries unofficially.", "\"As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases, whenever people want to travel, they will. And if the official paths are not opened, they will find unofficial paths,\" he said.", "He said the best way to track the virus was at official border crossings.", "Sars was a type of coronavirus that first emerged in China's Guangdong province in November 2002. By the time the outbreak ended the following July, it had spread to more than two dozen countries.", "The new coronavirus emerged only last month. So far, it has spread to fewer countries and - while more people have been infected globally - it has resulted in fewer deaths. ", "On Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases within China surpassed the Sars epidemic.", "Sars was also estimated to have cost the global economy more than $30bn (\u00a322bn).", "But economists have said the new coronavirus could have an even bigger impact on the world economy. It has forced global companies including tech giants, car makers and retailers to shut down temporarily in China.", "China was also criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the original Sars outbreak.", "It has been praised for responding to the latest virus with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities.", "But in his interview with CCTV on Friday, the Wuhan Communist Party chief said transport restrictions should have been brought in at least 10 days earlier. ", "\"The epidemic may have been alleviated somewhat, and not got to the current situation,\" Mr Ma said. ", "The estimates from the University of Hong Kong suggest the epidemic is doubling in size roughly every week and that multiple Chinese cities may have imported sufficient cases to start local epidemics.", "\"Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could potentially also become outbreak epicentres because of substantial spread of pre-symptomatic cases unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately,\" Professor Joseph Wu said. ", "Why is this outbreak more difficult to stop than Sars? ", "The answer is not down to China - the speed and scale of the country's response to this new virus is widely considered to be unprecedented. The difference is the way the virus behaves inside the human body.", "Sars was a brutal infection that you couldn't miss - patients were contagious only when they had symptoms. This made it relatively easy to isolate the sick and quarantine anyone who might have been exposed.", "But the new virus, 2019-nCov, is harder to spot and therefore harder to stop.", "From the virus's perspective, it has a far smarter evolutionary survival strategy than Sars.", "The best estimate is only one-in-five cases cause severe symptoms, so instead of infected people turning up in hospital, you have to go out and find them.", "And we are getting detailed documented cases of people spreading the virus before they even have symptoms.", "There is a tendency to focus only on how deadly a virus is. But it is this, in combination with a virus's ability to spread, that determines its true threat.", "A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has now reached every region in mainland China.", "The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, which is at the heart of the outbreak.", "The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. People who have been in Hubei are also being told to work from home. ", "China has said it will send charter planes to bring back Hubei residents who are overseas \"as soon as possible\". A foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the \"practical difficulties\" Chinese citizens had faced abroad.", "The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country.", "Voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals from Wuhan are under way.", "The UK, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion.", "Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas Island, 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland in a detention centre that has been used to house asylum seekers.", "In other recent developments:", "Have you been affected by any of the issues raised?

The lockdown had worked. ", "Nowadays, most quarantines are imposed by governments or health bodies.

It was later confirmed that he had died of the plague. Concerned, police officers strung rope and barbed wire around a section of Chinatown. Residents were not allowed to come in or out, and only police and health officials were allowed to cross the barrier. ", "During World War One, about 30,000 sex workers were quarantined amid fears about the number of rising sexually transmitted diseases. They were allowed to leave once it was confirmed they no longer had STDs. ", "Mr Harrison says the Sars epidemic of 2002-3 started a new era in infectious disease control.

the police for trying to warn colleagues about the dangers of a strange new virus infecting patients in his hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan.", "Now he'd succumbed to the illness himself and pictures of that frozen tribute spread fast on the Chinese internet, capturing in physical form a deep moment of national shock and anger.", "There's still a great deal we don't know about Covid-19, to give the disease caused by the virus its official name. Before it took its final fatal leap across the species barrier to infect its first human, it is likely to have been lurking inside the biochemistry of an - as yet unidentified - animal. That animal, probably infected after the virus made an earlier zoological jump from a bat, is thought to have been kept in a Wuhan market, where wildlife was traded illegally.", "Beyond that, the scientists trying to map its deadly trajectory from origin to epidemic can say little more with any certainty.", "But while they continue their urgent, vital work to determine the speed at which it spreads and the risks it poses, one thing is beyond doubt. A month or so on from its discovery, Covid-19 has shaken Chinese society and politics to the core.", "That tiny piece of genetic material, measured in ten-thousandths of a millimetre, has set in train a humanitarian and economic catastrophe counted in more than 1,000 Chinese lives and tens of billions of Chinese yuan. It has closed off whole cities, placing an estimated 70 million residents in effective quarantine, shutting down transport links and restricting their ability to leave their homes. And it has exposed the limits of a political system for which social control is the highest value, breaching the rigid layers of censorship with a tsunami of grief and rage.", "The risk for the ruling elite is obvious.", "It can be seen in their response, ordering into action the military, the media and every level of government from the very top to the lowliest village committee.", "The consequences are now entirely dependent on questions no one knows the answers to; can they pull off the complex task of bringing a runaway epidemic under control, and if so, how long might it take?", "Across the world, people seem unsure how to respond to the small number of cases being detected in their own countries. The public mood can swing between panic - driven by the pictures of medical workers in hazmat suits - to complacency, brought on by headlines that suggest the risk is no worse than flu. The evidence from China suggests that both responses are misguided. Seasonal flu may well have a low fatality rate, measured in fractions of 1%, but it's a problem because it affects so many people around the world.", "The tiny proportion killed out of the many, many millions who catch it each year still numbers in the hundreds of thousands - individually tragic, collectively a major healthcare burden.", "Very early estimates suggested the new virus may be at least as deadly as flu - precisely why so much effort is now going into stopping it becoming another global pandemic. But one new estimate suggests it could prove even deadlier yet, killing as many as 1% of those who contract it. For any individual, that risk is still relatively small, although it's worth noting such estimates are averages - just like flu, the risks fall more heavily on the elderly and already infirm.", "But China's experience of this epidemic demonstrates two things. Firstly, it offers a terrifying glimpse of the potential effect on a healthcare system when you scale up infections of this kind of virus across massive populations. Two new hospitals have had to be built in Wuhan in a matter of days, with beds for 2,600 patients, and giant stadiums and hotels are being used as quarantine centres, for almost 10,000 more.", "Despite these efforts, many have still struggled to find treatment, with reports of people dying at home, unregistered in the official figures. Secondly, it highlights the importance of taking the task of containing outbreaks of new viruses extremely seriously. The best approach, most experts agree, is one based on transparency and trust, with good public information and proportionate, timely government action.", "But in an authoritarian system, with strict censorship and an emphasis on political stability above all else, transparency and trust are in short supply.", "China's response may have sometimes looked like panic - with what's been called the \"biggest quarantine in history\" and harsh enforcement against those who disobey.", "But those measures have become necessary only because its initial response looked like the very definition of complacency.", "There's ample evidence that the warning signs were missed by the authorities, and worse, ignored. By late December, medical staff in Wuhan were beginning to notice unusual symptoms of viral pneumonia, with a cluster linked to the market trading in illegal wildlife. On 30 December, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan's Central Hospital, posted his concerns in a private medical chat group, advising colleagues to take measures to protect themselves. He'd seen seven patients who appeared to be suffering with an illness similar to Sars - another coronavirus that began in an illegal Chinese wildlife market in 2002 and went on to kill 774 people worldwide.", "A few days later, he was summoned by the police.", "Dr Li was made to sign a confession, denouncing the messages he'd posted as \"illegal behaviour\".", "The case received national media attention, with a high-profile state-run TV report announcing that in total, eight people in Wuhan were being investigated for \"spreading rumours\". The authorities, though, were well aware of the outbreak of illness. The day after Dr Li posted his message, China notified the World Health Organization, and the day after that, the suspected source - the market - was closed down.", "But despite the multiplying cases and the concerns among medics that human-to-human transmission was taking place, the authorities did little to protect the public. Doctors were already setting up quarantine rooms and anticipating extra admissions when Wuhan held its important annual political gathering, the city's People's Congress.", "In their speeches, the Communist Party leaders made no mention of the virus. China's National Health Commission continued to report that the number of infections was limited and that there was no clear evidence that the disease could spread between humans.", "And on 18 January the Wuhan authorities allowed a massive community banquet to take place, involving more than 40,000 families. The aim was to set a record for the most dishes served at an event. Two days later, China finally confirmed that human-to-human transmission was indeed taking place.", "Most remarkable of all perhaps, the following day, Wuhan held a Lunar New Year dance performance, attended by senior officials from across the surrounding province of Hubei. A state media report of the event, since hurriedly deleted but captured here, says the performers, some with runny noses and feeling unwell, \"overcame the fear of pneumonia... winning praise from the leaders\".", "By the time the national authorities had woken up to the impending disaster, and closed the city down on 23 January, it was too late - the epidemic was out of control. Before Wuhan's transport links were cut, an estimated five million people had left the city for the Lunar New Year break, travelling across China and the world.", "Some have begun calling the disaster \"China's Chernobyl\".", "The parallels in failures to pass bad news up the chain of command and the incentives to put the short-term interests of political stability ahead of public safety, seem all too apparent. Li Wenliang, who'd gone back to work after being warned to keep quiet, soon discovered he'd also been infected.", "He died earlier this month, leaving a five-year-old son and a pregnant wife.", "Anger was already simmering over the authorities' failure to issue timely warnings, with the crisis now being aired in full view. Wuhan's politicians were blaming senior officials for failing to authorise the release of the information; senior officials appeared to be preparing to hang Wuhan's politicians out to dry.", "But the death of a man, silenced for simply trying to protect his colleagues, burst open the dam with a wave of online fury directed not just at individuals, but at the system itself. So great was the public outrage, China's censors appeared unsure what to censor and what to let through. The hashtag #Iwantfreedomofspeech was viewed almost two million times before it was blocked. Aware of the tide of emotion, the Party began paying its own tributes to Dr Li.", "It quickly hailed him a national hero.", "China's rulers, untroubled by the inconveniences of the ballot box, have far deeper and older fears of what might sweep them from office. The wars, famines and diseases that shook the dynasties of old have given them their inheritance; an acute historical sense of the danger of the unforeseen crisis. They will also know well what Chernobyl did for the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party in the former USSR.", "\"It's impossible to know if Li Wenliang's death will serve as the catalyst for something bigger,\" Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, tells me. \"But the raw emotion that surged when news of his condition broke indicates deep levels of frustration and anger exist within the country.\"", "Precisely because it feels the weight of history, however, the Communist Party has made holding onto power a living obsession, and it has an ever more formidable domestic security apparatus to help it to do so. Over the past few decades it has proven nothing if not resilient, enduring through political chaos, devastating earthquakes and man-made disasters.", "But one sign that might hint at an awareness of just how great the current risks are comes in the role being played by China's President Xi Jinping. This week - for the first time since the crisis began - he ventured out to meet health workers involved in the fight, visiting a hospital and a virus control centre in Beijing.", "In contrast, his premier, Li Keqiang, has been sent to the front lines in Wuhan and appointed head of a special working group to tackle the epidemic. ", "While it is common for the premier to be the face of reassurance during national disasters, some observers see another reason why Mr Xi might be wise to be seen to delegate.", "\"Xi's absence from this crisis is yet another demonstration that he doesn't so much lead as he does command,\" Mr Blanchette says. \"He's clearly worried that this crisis will blow up in his face, and so he's pushed out underlings to be the public face of the CCP's response.\"", "Already there are signs that the censorship is being ratcheted up once again, with Mr Xi ordering senior officials to \"strengthen the control over online media\". ", "A few days ago, I spoke by phone to the lawyer and blogger, Chen Qiushi, who'd travelled to Wuhan in an attempt to provide independent reporting about the situation. Videos from Mr Chen, and a fellow activist, Fang Bin, have been widely watched, showing not the ranks of patriotic soldier-medics and the building of hospitals that fill state media coverage, but overcrowded waiting rooms and body bags.", "He told me he was unsure how long he'd be able to carry on. \"The censorship is very strict and people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content,\" he said.", "Mr Chen has since gone missing.", "Friends and family believe he's been forced into Wuhan's quarantine system, in an attempt to silence him. ", "China's leaders now find their fate linked to the daily charts of infection rates, published city by city, province by province. There are some signs that the extraordinary quarantine measures may be having an effect - outside of Hubei Province, the worst affected area, the number of new daily infections is falling.", "But with the need to try to restart the economy - all but frozen now for over a week - the country has begun a slow return to work.", "Strict quarantine measures will remain in force in the worst affected areas, but workers from other parts of the country are trickling back to the cities, with the task of monitoring and managing their movements being handed to local neighbourhood committees.", "It will be a difficult balancing act.", "Too tough an approach risks further choking off business activity, commerce and travel in a consumer environment already suffocating under the deep psychological fear of contagion. Too lax, and any one of the many potential reservoirs of infection, now scattered across the country, could explode into another, separate epidemic.", "That would require further harsh action, knocking domestic confidence and prolonging the international border closures and flight restrictions put in place at such enormous economic cost.", "China is insisting that it is a fight well on the way to being won with \"unconquerable will\" and that lessons have been learned and \"shortcomings in preparedness\" identified.", "Questions about the systemic failings behind the disaster are dismissed as foreign \"prejudice\", as the propaganda machine cranks into overdrive, channelling the narrative and muting the criticisms.", "But the devastating scale and scope of China's world-threatening catastrophe have already revealed something important. The thousands who have lost family members, the millions living under the quarantine measures and the workers and businesses bearing the financial costs have been asking those difficult questions too.", "On the snowy banks of the Tonghui river, the giant tribute to Li Wenliang remains intact.

", "Travellers are checked for fever, cold and cough symptoms - airport staff on the lookout for any sign of the coronavirus. ", "The country's open borders and interconnectedness as well as its pro-active approach to testing means it has reported one of the highest tallies outside mainland China - 50. ", "\"We are vulnerable, but we have to do everything that we can to contain that spread of the virus,\" says Lawrence Wong, co-chair of Singapore's task force on the coronavirus. ", "But when a virus comes to Singapore it won't just affect this city. It can and has spread through Singapore to other countries around the world. ", "This became painfully obvious when one meeting held in a luxury hotel in mid-January spawned several coronavirus cases around the world.", "More than 100 people attended the sales conference, including some from China.", "About a week after that meeting, stories of confirmed coronavirus cases began popping up all over the world - from South Korea to Malaysia, the UK and even Spain. ", "The first Malaysian to catch the virus was a 41-year-old man who had attended the conference along with colleagues from China.", "Subsequently, his sister and mother-in-law caught it from him.", "Then, South Korea confirmed two infected cases of South Korean nationals who had also attended the meeting. ", "Singapore reported three cases: two Singaporean nationals and a permanent resident.", "British national and super-spreader Steve Walsh was also at the Singapore conference. ", "After his meetings in the tropical city-state he flew to a French ski resort for a holiday, on his way back home.", "He is thought to have infected 11 others while he was there - people who eventually flew elsewhere - leading to five cases in England, five in France, and one in Majorca, Spain. ", "This one meeting demonstrates how Singapore became a super-conductor for the virus.", "And the worry is it's not just one conference.", "Singapore is at risk of spreading the virus precisely because it is a top destination for business meetings and international travellers. ", "The city-state is a big draw for Chinese businesses too, given the close economic links between the two countries - 3.62m Chinese visitors came to Singapore in 2019, making up the largest group. ", "With Chinese tourists shunning Hong Kong because of the anti-government protests there, many chose to come to Singapore over the Lunar New Year holidays - which coincided with the coronavirus outbreak.", "\"We are very mindful that we are indeed an open economy, we are an international travel hub,\" Mr Wong says. \"So we are doing all we can to contain that spread. We are putting out information in a very transparent manner and we continue to work with all health authorities overseas.\"", "At home, Singapore is stepping up its coronavirus response by taking extreme measures.", "It immediately understood the implications of spread in a densely-populated city. Indeed, eight of the 50 cases reported so far have no known links to clusters that had been in contact with Chinese travellers from Wuhan. That is likely to be of concern because it means the linking cases out there could yet pass on the illness to others.

in Japan, England's chief medical officer said.", "They have now been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres.", "Two patients are in the Royal Hallamshire in Sheffield, one is in the Royal in Liverpool and a fourth was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, NHS England said.", "Prof Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus said: \"These specialist centres are well prepared to deal with cases and earlier this year the Newcastle unit successfully treated and discharged two patients who had contracted the virus.\"", "Prof Willett added there had been a \"calm response\" to confirmed cases of coronavirus so far, \"which will continue to be important as more of us might need to self-isolate for a time, to protect ourselves, our families and the community\".", "Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said the four new cases were not surprising and would present no risk to the

", "Far more concerning is the situation in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where there is human-to-human spread of the virus in the community, which could eventually lead to the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic.   ", "Arrowe Park Hospital was previously used to isolate 83 British nationals who were flown back to the UK from Wuhan on the Foreign Office's first evacuation flight in January.", "Janelle Holmes, chief executive at Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Trust reassured staff that the hospital was \"running as usual\".", "\"When guests arrived yesterday evening, we followed clear guidance in relation to infection prevention control. This was to minimise the chance of any infection spreading.\"", "The evacuees had already spent two weeks in quarantine on board the cruise ship, but since then 600 passengers and crew have tested positive for the new virus, raising fears that the incubation period for the virus may be longer than originally thought.", "Separately, four Britons from the ship who recently tested positive for the new coronavirus were not on Saturday's repatriation flight.", "They included David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who have since been diagnosed with pneumonia, according to their family and are being treated in a Japanese hospital.", "Relatives said the couple are both \"having a really tough time\" and feel \"very much in the dark\" in terms of treatment, adding that they are awaiting further tests.", "The new strain of coronavirus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19.", "China has seen more than 76,000 infections and 2,442 deaths.

deadly coronavirus jumped from animals to humans.

A wild animal, possibly a pangolin snuffling for insects among the leaves, picks up the infection from the excrement.", "The novel virus circulates in wildlife. Eventually an infected animal is captured, and a person somehow catches the disease, then passes it on to workers at a wildlife market. A global outbreak is born. ", "Scientists are attempting to prove the truth of this scenario as they work to find wild animals harbouring the virus. Finding the sequence of events is \"a bit of a detective story\", says Prof Andrew Cunningham of Zoological Society London (ZSL). A range of wild animal species could be the host, he says, in particular bats, which harbour a large number of different coronaviruses.", "So how much do we know about the \"spillover event\", as it's known in the trade? When scientists cracked the code of the new virus, taken from the body of a patient, bats in China were implicated.", "The mammals gather in large colonies, fly long distances and are present on every continent. They rarely get sick themselves, but have the opportunity to spread pathogens far and wide. According to Prof Kate Jones of University College London, there is some evidence bats have adapted to the energetic demands of flight and are better at repairing DNA damage. \"This might enable them to cope with a higher burden of viruses before getting sick - but this is just an idea at present.\" ", "There's no doubt that the behaviour of bats allows viruses to thrive. \"When you consider the very way that they live, then they are going to have a large array of viruses,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball from the University of Nottingham. \"And because they're mammals there's a possibility that some of them can infect humans either directly or through an intermediate host species.\"", "The second part of the puzzle, then, is the identity of the mystery animal that incubated the virus in its body and possibly ended up in the market at Wuhan. One suspect for the smoking gun is the pangolin. ", "The ant-devouring scaly mammal, said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world, is threatened with extinction. The animal's scales are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine, while pangolin meat is considered a delicacy by some. ", "Coronaviruses have been found in pangolins, some claimed to be a close match to the novel human virus. Could the bat virus and pangolin virus have traded genetics before spreading to humans? Experts are cautious about drawing any conclusions. Full data on the pangolin study has not been released, making the information impossible to verify.", "Prof Cunningham says the provenance and number of pangolins examined for the research is especially important. \"For example, were there multiple animals sampled directly in the wild (in which case the results would be more meaningful), or was a single animal from a captive environment or wet market sampled (in which case conclusions about the true host of the virus could not be robustly made)?\"", "Pangolins and other wild species, including a variety of species of bat, are often sold in wet markets, he says, providing opportunities for viruses to move from one species to another. \"Wet markets, therefore, create ideal conditions for the spillover of pathogens from one species to another, including to people.\"", "The market in Wuhan, which was closed down after the outbreak, had a wild animal section, where live and slaughtered species were on sale, including body parts of camels, koalas and birds.  The Guardian reports that an inventory at one shop listed live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions, bamboo rats, squirrels, foxes, civets, hedgehogs (probably porcupines), salamanders, turtles and crocodiles.", "As far as we know, bats and pangolins weren't listed, but authorities in China will have intelligence on what animals were being sold, says Prof Ball. \"If the spillover's happened once, you want to know whether or not this sort of thing can happen again, because it's important from a public health standpoint,\" he says. \"And so you need to know exactly what species of animal it's in and also what were the risks that gave rise to that spillover event.\"", "Many of the viruses we have become familiar with in recent years have crossed over from wild animals. This is the story of Ebola, HIV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and now coronavirus. Prof Jones says the rise in infectious disease events from wildlife might be because of our increasing ability to detect them, growing connectivity to each other, or more encroachment into wild habitats, thereby \"changing landscapes and coming into contact with new viruses the human population hasn't seen before\".", "If we understand the risk factors, we can take steps to prevent it happening in the first place without adversely affecting wild animals, says Prof Cunningham.  Conservationists are at pains to point out that although bats are thought to carry many viruses, they are also essential for ecosystems to function. \"Insectivorous bats eat huge volumes of insects such as mosquitoes and agricultural pests, while fruit bats pollinate trees and spread their seeds,\" he says. \"It is imperative that these species are not culled through misguided 'disease control' measures.\"", "After Sars in 2002-3, caused by a very similar coronavirus to the one now emerging in China and beyond, there was a temporary ban on wild animal markets. But the markets quickly sprang up again across China, Vietnam and other parts of south-east Asia. ", "China has again suspended the buying and selling of wild-animal products, which are commonly used for food, fur and in traditional medicines. Reports suggest this may be made permanent. ", "While we may never know exactly how or where the disease responsible for many deaths made the leap into humans, Prof Diana Bell of the University of East Anglia says we can prevent another \"perfect storm\". \"We are bringing together animals from different countries, different habitats, different lifestyles - in terms of aquatic animals, arboreal animals and so on - and mixing them together and it's a kind of melting pot - and we've got to stop doing it.\"", "Follow Helen on Twitter."], "content-summary": " Follow Helen on Twitter.", "content-lemmas": [["race", "find", "deadly",
