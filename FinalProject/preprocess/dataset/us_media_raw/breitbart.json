The Chinese Communist Party said it originated in a food market in Wuhan. Yet an authoritative study in the Lancet, the respected international science journal, by Chinese scientists, refuted that almost conclusively. Fourteen of the original 41 cases had no contact with that food market whatsoever.\u201d",

I don\u2019t know where this virus originated. Natural causes somewhere other than that food market is still the most likely hypothesis.\u201d",

            "If so, it would appear that Cummings has been outfoxed. Heaven knows what arch-retainer Sedwill may have promised in order to keep his job but it looks like he was speaking with forked tongue or, perhaps, that he concocted some kind of devil\u2019s pact where he agreed to put his weight behind a frictionless Brexit in return for being granted certain favours in return. If that is indeed the case \u2013 though it\u2019s pure speculation on my part \u2013 then the British people have been very ill-served by this stitch-up.",

            "Rather than nip the problem in the bud, China has behaved exactly as you would expect a secretive, totalitarian regime to behave: lying about the virility and morbidity of the infection; allowing as many as 5 million people to leave Wuhan before any quarantine was able to take effect; lobbying the World Health Organisation not to declare it a global emergency.",
            "And this is a regime that Britain is now trusting with its wireless technology?",
            "The Huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything Boris Johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration.",
            "It\u2019s also a betrayal of the very thing on which Boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful Brexit.",
            "One of the key elements in Boris\u2019s vision of a bright, post-Brexit future for Britain outside the European Union is international trade: all those incredible deals Britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by EU regulations \u2013 starting, of course, with the \u2018very big deal\u2019 promised by President Trump with the U.S.",
            "But Trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if Britain ignores its allies\u2019 security concerns and goes ahead with the Huawei deal.",
            "If you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the Remain-biased Civil Service \u2014 led by arch-Remainer Mark Sedwill \u2014 is using the Huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage Boris\u2019s post-Brexit deals in order to make the Brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the EU more likely. You would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment.",

            "Despite the common use of places of origin to name pathogens \u2013 the Ebola virus is named after the Ebola River where it originated, for example \u2013 China has pressured the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid associating the novel coronavirus with China in any way. As a result, the WHO has decreed the official name of the virus to be \u201cSARS-CoV-2,\u201d so as to associate it with the virus that causes Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and the name of the disease the virus causes \u201cCOVID-19.\u201d",
            "The confusing, China-approved names have already caused international confusion. Indonesian officials insisted for some time that they did not have any cases of the Chinese virus because health experts said some patients were carrying \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d but not \u201cCOVID-19,\u201d and failed to refer to the virus at any time as the same as the one originating in Wuhan.",

            "Secretary of State Pompeo, in a series of media appearances on Friday, rejected these theories, referring to the virus as \u201cWuhan coronavirus.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe Wuhan virus that began at the end of last year is something that this administration is taking incredibly seriously,\u201d Pompeo said on an appearance on\u00a0Fox & Friends on Friday. When asked why he used the name, Pompeo said, \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has said that this is where the virus started. So don\u2019t take my word for it; take theirs.\u00a0 They are right on this one.\u201d",

So don\u2019t take Mike Pompeo\u2019s word for it,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe have pretty high confidence that we know where this began, and we have high confidence too that there was information that could have been made available more quickly and data that could have been provided and shared among health professionals across the world. It\u2019s most unfortunate.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt has proven incredibly frustrating to work with the Chinese Communist Party to get our hands around the data set which will ultimately be the solution to both getting the vaccine and attacking this risk,\u201d Pompeo lamented.",

            "\u201cAs the chief U.S. diplomat, Pompeo insisted on speaking of the \u2018Wuhan virus\u2019 despite the opposition of WHO and international public opinion, in an attempt to arouse resentment among those affected countries against China,\u201d the\u00a0Global Times asserted. \u201cPompeo\u2019s move not only exposes malicious U.S. intentions toward China without regard to common sense, but also hits a new low in his personal conduct.\u201d",
            "\u201cHis speaking of the \u2018Wuhan virus\u2019 was rude and vicious, and the accusation was ridiculous,\u201d the propaganda newspaper continued. \u201cWHO has more than once praised China for providing the world with transparent information. What kind of special information does Pompeo want?\u201d",
            "\u201cNaming it \u2018Wuhan virus\u2019 is scientifically groundless and morally irresponsible,\u201d the\u00a0Global Times\u00a0concluded.",

            "Similarly, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, in response to a question about Pompeo\u2019s remarks, called them \u201cdespicable.\u201d",
            "\u201cDespite the fact that the WHO has officially named this novel type of coronavirus, certain American politician [sic], disrespecting science and the WHO decision, jumped at the first chance to stigmatize China and Wuhan with it. We condemn this despicable practice,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Monday.",
            "Geng also disputed Pompeo\u2019s assertion that China has been opaque with its data and uncooperative with America.",
            "\u201cSince the COVID-19 broke out, China has been providing timely updates to the WHO and countries and regions including the US in an open, transparent and responsible manner. We have shared with them the genetic sequencing of the virus, responded to their concerns and strengthened international cooperation,\u201d Geng said. \u201cThe world has already reached the clear, fair consensus that China\u2019s contribution bought precious time for the international community to enhance preparedness. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s attempt to smear China\u2019s efforts will not succeed.\u201d",
            "China documented the first cases of Chinese coronavirus in Wuhan as early as late November, according to some reports. The Communist Party notified the WHO of an unidentified source on pneumonia in early January and shut down a wild meat market in Wuhan on January 1, the market initially considered the source of the outbreak. Beijing did not notify Wuhan residents of any contagious disease spreading, nor did it announce the discovery of the new virus to the world, until January 20. In that span of nearly a month, Wuhan hosted an attempt at the world\u2019s largest banquet, directed at the elderly, the most vulnerable group to severe pneumonia as a result of the virus.",
            "China also moved to arrest and punish anyone, particularly health professionals, who shared safety tips on how to combat contagion. One of the punished individuals, Dr. Li Wenliang, died of coronavirus-related infection in early February, shortly after becoming a local hero for revealing that he was treating a contagious respiratory disease in Wuhan with other doctors. Chinese police apprehended Li and forced him to sign a humiliating statement apologizing for spreading \u201crumors.\u201d China has posthumously attempted to praise Li as a fine example of communist medical values.",
            "Reports have surfaced for months accusing China of deliberately deflating coronavirus counts by refusing to test those with symptoms \u201cunapproved\u201d by the Communist Party. Local crematory workers in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, have anonymously asserted that they were overloaded by the hundreds of bodies, suggesting a much higher death count than the official tally.",
            "Chinese officials initially diverted blame away from Beijing towards local officials but admitted to incompetence and secrecy in handling the outbreak. More recently, China has begun floating the theory the virus did not originate in China at all, despite no evidence to the contrary.",

            "The government of Japan confirmed on Thursday that two people infected with the Chinese coronavirus died onboard the Diamond Princess, a quarantined cruise ship in which over 600 people have tested positive for the virus.",
            "Japan\u2019s\u00a0Asahi Shimbun reports the two patients were a man and woman in their 80s, both of whom had been relocated out of the ship to a medical facility after falling ill. The newly discovered coronavirus, which has infected upwards of 70,000 people since mid-December, causes respiratory failure and symptoms like fever, body aches, and difficulty breathing. Of those onboard the cruise ship, 29 are reportedly in serious condition.",
            "Health officials confirmed that the male patient was a coronavirus carrier on February 12, a little over a week before he died. The couple are the first two passengers on the cruise ship to die.",
            "The cruise ship had been traveling around east Asia when authorities in Hong Kong confirmed that a man who had disembarked in Hong Kong was a coronavirus carrier, according to Japan\u2019s\u00a0Mainichi Shimbun. At the time, on February 2, Japan responded by docking the ship but isolating all those on board. Yokohama was the Diamond Princess\u2019s initial point of departure.",
            "Japan docked the cruise ship at the port of Yokohama and has forbidden passengers from leaving, transferring confirmed coronavirus patients to hospitals and monitoring the others for potential infection. The ship was carrying over 3,000 people when the government instituted the isolation measure, which it insists has kept the virus from spreading within Japan itself.",
            "Japan has currently documented over 90 cases nationwide and one death, also a woman in her 80s, not counting the 621 cases on the Diamond Princess. Japanese officials reportedly insisted that the World Health Organization (WHO) not count the Diamond Princess cases as cases within Japan, as it gives the impression that the virus is spreading more rapidly on the island nation than the numbers for just Japan would indicate.",
            "The cruise ship has confirmed more coronavirus cases on its own than any other country in the world except for China, which has confirmed 74,579 cases at press time.",
            "In addition to the two deaths, Japan also confirmed seven new coronavirus cases on Thursday outside of the ship. One of the individuals was identified as having received care at a hospital where the woman who died of coronavirus in Japan had also been, suggesting potential issues with protective measures in health facilities nationwide. Adding to the concern was the nature of the new cases on the cruise ship, as well, including government officials who were helping manage to isolate the ship and fell ill.",
            "Police officers wearing protective suits and masks are seen as they leave the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked at the Daikoku Pier on February 20, 2020 in Yokohama, Japan. Passengers who have tested negative for the coronavirus (COVID-19) have been disembarking the cruise ship since Wednesday, as at least 634 passengers and crew onboard have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19). Including cases onboard the ship, 718 people in Japan have now been diagnosed with COVID-19, making it the worst affected country outside of China. (Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images)",
            "The rapidly increasing number of cases on the ship has led to sharp criticism of both the government and the cruise line responsible for the ship. Speaking to\u00a0Asahi, an unnamed man trapped on the ship complained that it took days for the ship\u2019s crew to begin wearing protective gear like gloves and face masks.",
            "\u201cI got the impression that the passengers and the crew did not take seriously the risks of infection for a while after the ship\u2019s arrival at Yokohama,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI am afraid that precautions against the infection were not thorough in some respects.\u201d",
            "Citing eyewitness accounts, Asahi described a chaotic situation for the crew on the ship.",
            "\u201cSome of the employees could not stop coughing, and other crew members had to be taken to hospitals by ambulance. Crew members share cabins and eat together in a dining hall,\u201d the newspaper detailed.",
            "The man added that those with symptoms had to wait on long lines to see medical staff, as there were not enough doctors and other medical professionals to care for the hundreds who fell ill. This caused a delay in treatment that likely exacerbated the spread of the virus, he posited.",
            "He also noted that there was no indication of officials separating individuals carrying the virus from those still feeling healthy or shutting down parts of the ship where infected people may have been. The virus is believed to spread through aerosol droplets in the air, making it highly contagious.",
            "Mainichi relayed the concerns within the government that handling of the cruise ship outbreak will hurt popular sentiment towards Prime Minister Abe Shinzo\u2019s administration.",
            "\u201cJust the return of 100-odd people per chartered flight [from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak] created chaos. There\u2019s no facility that can accommodate 30 times as many people,\u201d an unnamed Abe official told the newspaper.",
            "The coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, central China, and is believed to have been triggered by the consumption of wild game at a meat market in the city. After China alerted the world to the existence of a new, highly contagious virus \u2013 20 days after officially shutting down the market and privately informing WHO officials \u2013 many of the world\u2019s nations began evacuating citizens from the region. Japan, the official in the\u00a0Mainichi article contended, was too occupied trying to save its citizens in Wuhan and overextended itself, leaving the Diamond Princess situation understaffed.",
            "Even while admitting this, anonymous officials speaking to the newspaper appeared frustrated over the criticism.",

            "Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) published a study this week rating Abe\u2019s response to the outbreak positively, finding that preventing Diamond Princess passengers from landing in Japan likely prevented infections.",

            "Taiwan is a sovereign, democratic state that has never in its history been part of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The WHO, a United Nations body, refuses to accept Taiwan as a member due to longstanding bullying from the Chinese Communist Party. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly denounced the organization\u2019s decision to exclude one of the most prosperous nations in Asia, particularly in light of a situation the WHO itself has branded a public health emergency of international concern.",
            "The Chinese communist regime announced it had identified a newly discovered coronavirus in central Wuhan, China, on January 20, despite evidence that officials were aware for nearly a month that a potentially deadly outbreak had begun in Wuhan\u2019s Hubei province. As of Tuesday,\u00a0officials have documented 20,702 cases of the new coronavirus worldwide. Of those, 427 people have died, the overwhelming majority in China.",
            "The novel coronavirus initially produced flu-like symptoms, particularly fever, and in many patients appears to escalate into pneumonia and risk of death. Medical experts have estimates, but no confirmation, regarding how long the virus\u2019s incubation period is and how contagious a person is at that time.",
            "As the WHO claims to be in communication with Taiwan through the adversarial Beijing regime, it also claims to have accurate tallies of the number of coronavirus cases in the country. It placed that number at 13 on Tuesday, misidentifying the country as part of China.",
            "\u201cThis is fake news,\u201d\u00a0Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung said of the total. At the time, Taiwan had listed ten individuals as confirmed coronavirus patients; at press time, doctors have confirmed an eleventh case. Chen said his government had issued an official complaint to the WHO for both the wrong number and for falsely identifying Taiwan as part of China.",
            "The remarks followed an emergency WHO executive board meeting to address the outbreak in which Chinese communist officials claimed they were keeping Taiwan informed and prepared for any growing number of cases. China\u2019s official at the meeting claimed that Beijing had been regularly keeping in contact with its officials in all its provinces and regions, including Taiwan among them, according to Focus Taiwan. The Taiwanese government vocally denied this claim.",

            "The virus \u2013 officially given the cumbersome name \u201cCOVID-19\u201d to attempt to disassociate it with its country of origin \u2013 has infected nearly 80,000 people as of Monday and killed over 2,600, most of them in China. Wuhan, the city where the virus first began to spread in December, is currently on lockdown, forbidding people to leave the house outside of government-controlled trips to buy food and other basic supplies. Every province of China has documented cases of the virus and a study released last week indicated that Beijing was wrong to conclude that the virus originated in a wild meat market in the city.",
            "\u201cThis is a crisis for us and it is also a major test,\u201d Xi reportedly told the viewers, which included county Communist Party officials from the entire nation and senior military leaders. Xi urged them to learn from the \u201cobvious shortcomings exposed\u201d by the virus the\u00a0South China Morning Post noted him saying, and then offered vague, simple commands such as telling the Party to \u201cresolutely curb the spread of epidemic\u201d and \u201cincrease the rate of treatment and cure\u201d in Wuhan.",
            "Outside of Wuhan and its Hubei province, Xi insisted on placing major emphasis on containing the virus in Beijing, where he lives. The\u00a0Morning Post noted that he and the senior leaders of the Communist Politburo were the only ones in the broadcast not wearing sanitary masks.",
            "The newspaper did not list any shortcomings that Xi may have specifically identified. Among the failures of the Chinese government since the outbreak began were not telling hospital staff in Wuhan to quarantine patients because the virus is contagious, arresting doctors who warned other health professionals that they had reason to believe the virus was dangerous, and pouring more resources into silencing criticism of the government over the response online than into actually combatting the outbreak.",
            "Radio Free Asia (RFA), which uses dissident reports on the ground, reported last week that the situation in Wuhan has worsened in part because of the number of healthcare workers who are fighting the virus themselves after testing positive for it. At least three of Wuhan\u2019s high-profile doctors have died in the ensuing outbreak. The highest-ranking doctor, Liu Zhiming, was the director of the city\u2019s central hospital. Li Wenliang, the first doctor identified to have died of coronavirus, was arrested and humiliated by Wuhan police after posting a warning to a closed doctors\u2019 group on WeChat that he believed the virus was contagious. Chinese propaganda attempted to portray him as a Party hero, but his death triggered significant outrage nationwide against the government. The third doctor, Peng Yinhua, appeared in Party propaganda because he had delayed his wedding to stay in Wuhan and help treat patients. Peng was 29 years old.",
            "RFA cited several anonymous sources in Wuhan who said they had seen other hospital directors and doctors struggling to work while sick with coronavirus. It added that the outbreak appears to be worsening because health workers simply do not have the equipment necessary to protect themselves.",
            "RFA has also called into question on several occasions the official government death count, noting that sources in Wuhan have evidence of constant cremations at city crematoria. The\u00a0Epoch Times similarly reported this month that Wuhan is cremating hundreds of coronavirus victims a day, an unsustainable rate if the official death toll is accurate.",
            "At press time, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 79,407 cases of coronavirus and 2,622 deaths, the overwhelming majority in China. The virus has spread to nearly every continent; South Korea and Iran are believed to have some of the highest numbers of patients.",
            "Instead of mentioning these concerns, Xi praised the communist system, claiming the out-of-control circumstances in China are somehow proof of the supremacy of communism as a political system.",
            "\u201cThe effectiveness of the prevention and control work has once again demonstrated the significant advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,\u201d he reportedly said, also predicting that China\u2019s economy would thrive despite the virus rendering most manufacturing impossible.",
            "The\u00a0Global Times, a Chinese government propaganda outlet, called the \u201cmeeting\u201d \u2013 which did not require Xi to actually meet most of the attendees \u2013 \u201cunprecedented,\u201d \u201chistoric,\u201d and \u201cremarkable.\u201d It applauded Xi, citing Chinese \u201cexperts,\u201d for organizing the meeting, without addressing the actual outbreak response.",
            "\u201cPresident Xi understands very well the frontline situation, which is also impressive,\u201d an unnamed \u201cParty secretary\u201d reportedly told the\u00a0Global Times after listening to Xi\u2019s speech. Similarly, the government-controlled Xinhua news agency claimed that the speech elicited praise from \u201cscholars and observers around the world.\u201d",
            "While Chinese media repeatedly referred to the event as a \u201cmeeting,\u201d there is no evidence anyone but Xi spoke at it, suggesting it was more of an address to a closed number of people.",

            "A report published by the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab on Tuesday charged the Chinese government with heavily censoring news and discussion of the coronavirus outbreak beginning at the end of December. ",
            "The report noted that China\u2019s broad censorship practices could \u201crestrict vital communication related to disease information and prevention.\u201d",
            "The timing of China\u2019s censorship is crucial, as the last week of December was the period when whistleblower doctors in Wuhan began warning colleagues about an epidemic the government refused to acknowledge.\u00a0",
            "The most famous of those doctors, Li Wenliang, was arrested and threatened for spreading \u201cfalse rumors,\u201d remodeled as a hero of the Communist Party once the existence of the Wuhan virus could no longer be concealed, and killed by the virus at the beginning of February \u2013 at which point the Communist Party tried to conceal his death for as long as possible.",
            "The Citizen Lab report detected the beginning of large-scale censorship on the popular YY live-streaming and WeChat messaging platforms based on keywords and phrases related to the virus at the end of December. Blocked content included \u201ccriticism of the Chinese government, speculative and factual information related to the epidemic and neutral references to Chinese government efforts to handle the outbreak that had been reported on state media.\u201d",
            "The information control effort went far beyond blocking chat-room discussions that made Chinese officials uncomfortable. Censorship and intimidation are\u00a0intensifying even as the Chinese government claims the epidemic is coming under control:",
            "Government briefings and media reports show that the Chinese authorities delayed releasing information on the epidemic to the public. When eight individuals (at least two of which were medical experts) tried to warn the public of the then mysterious outbreak on December 30, 2019, they were silenced and punished by local authorities in Wuhan for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d and \u201cdisturbing social order.\u201d",
            "On Feb 5, 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the top-level Internet governance agency in China, issued a public statement stressing that it would punish \u201cwebsites, platforms, and accounts\u201d for publishing \u201charmful\u201d content and \u201cspreading fear\u201d related to COVID-19. The CAC singled out Sina Weibo, Tencent, and ByteDance in the statement, saying that it would carry out \u201cthematic inspection\u201d of their platforms.",
            "Chinese authorities continue to warn the public of the consequences of \u201cspreading rumours.\u201d A non-comprehensive collection of police announcements on the punishment of \u201crumour-mongers\u201d shows that at least 40 people were subject to warnings, fines, and/or administrative or criminal detention around January 24 and 25, 2020. Another announcement points to a much larger number, detailing 254 cases of citizens penalized for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d in China between January 22 and 28, 2020.",
            "Of particular interest to those considering commercial and technical relations with Chinese companies is Citizen Lab\u2019s observation that much of the censorship was performed by nominally \u201cprivate\u201d corporations such as Tencent, the owner of WeChat. Long before government censors begin stepping in to delete posts the Communist Party doesn\u2019t like, Chinese corporations are searching for blacklisted phrases and automatically suppressing messages that pass through their servers.\u00a0",
            "Citizen Lab\u2019s researchers demonstrated this by sending identical messages through U.S. and Canadian accounts versus Chinese accounts. Messages containing blacklisted phrases were instantly blocked without warning or notification when they passed through the Chinese account \u2013 recipients simply never saw the messages or knew they had been sent.\u00a0",
            "Mentioning Chinese President Xi Jinping, other top Communist officials, or Dr. Li Wenliang in the same message as the coronavirus proved to be a reliable formula for getting messages blocked. Another good way to get a message flushed down the censorship toilet was to discuss how Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau has responded to the virus epidemic.",
            "A great deal of the messages Citizen Lab saw blocked during their testing contained factual information about the coronavirus, including techniques for avoiding infection.",
            "\u201cSince the outbreak, government officials and Party leaders have been stressing the importance of \u2018public opinion guidance\u2019 and \u2018leadership over news and propaganda.\u2019 Limiting the dissemination of speculative information about the disease may be an attempt to reduce public fear, for example. On the other hand, censoring keywords critical of central leadership and government actors may be an effort to avoid embarrassment and maintain a positive image of the government,\u201d the University of Toronto report noted.",
            "One especially ugly smoking gun revealed by the report was that early examples of keyword censorship were detected several weeks before the Chinese government admitted the Wuhan virus could be passed between humans.\u00a0",
            "This \u201cstrongly suggests that social media companies came under government pressure to censor information at early stages of the outbreak,\u201d researchers noted. It also means information that could have helped Wuhan residents avoid the coronavirus was suppressed by their government, and it wasn\u2019t the work of a few misguided local goons in the Wuhan city government, as the national Chinese Communist Party has claimed."

            "Human rights activists have issued warnings that the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, could pose a dire threat to prisoners in western China\u2019s Muslim concentration camps, Radio Free Asia (RFA) noted on Thursday.",
            "China is currently believed to be housing as many as 3 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim ethnic minorities in over a thousand concentration camps in western Xinjiang province. There, survivors say they are subject to a litany of human rights atrocities, from sexual torture such as rape, forced sterilization, and forced abortion to traditional torture such as electroshock and sleep deprivation. Others have testified to being forced into slave labor, the fruits of which ended up in part in American stores.",
            "Beijing has repeatedly called the camps \u201cvocational training centers\u201d and insisted that they are educational facilities where unskilled workers develop talents they can use to find jobs in the Chinese market. With jobs, Communist Party leaders have argued, Muslims will be less likely to be attracted to jihadist groups. Relatives of those imprisoned dispute this claim, identifying many prisoners who had successful careers before disappearing into the camps.",
            "Chinese authorities have identified two cases of the Wuhan virus in Xinjiang, both reportedly middle-aged men. At press time, no reports indicate the men have died, but they have also not identified the men or their condition. Both cases are of men who recently traveled to Wuhan, which indicates they are not Uyghur Muslims, as the Communist Party subjects Uyghurs to extreme limitations on travel.",
            "The Communist Party revealed on Monday that it had documented the genome of the new virus and shared it with global health experts to help prevent it from spreading further. Reports throughout the week indicate that Chinese officials had reason to believe the virus was dangerous and highly contagious before this time, however, and did not properly alert medical professionals handling the cases, causing the virus to spread much faster than it would have with proper protection.",
            "There is no indication at press time that the Chinese regime has put any safety protocols in place in Xinjiang, much less in the camps. The Party alleged in December that all concentration camp prisoners had \u201cgraduated\u201d from the \u201cvocational centers,\u201d so technically the Chinese government denies that anyone currently lives in these camps.",

            "\u201cChina should do everything in its power to prevent the spread of the Wuhan virus into any camps because the consequences will be catastrophic, resulting possibly in the deaths of tens of thousands of Uyghurs arbitrarily detained in the past three years,\u201d Isa added, urging China to allow global health organizations such as the International Red Cross and the World Health Organization (WHO) to access the camps.",
            "The WHO has already effusively praised China for its response to the outbreak and banned Taiwan, at China\u2019s behest, from contributing to global virus containment, making it an unlikely partner to secure the camps.",
            "Beijing has repeatedly sought an Interpol red notice, or call for the arrest, for Dolkun Isa in response to his group\u2019s call for respect for the human rights of the Uyghur people, with no success. Shortly after the president of Interpol, Meng Hongwei, refused to grant the red notice, Beijing detained him without notice and disappeared him from the public eye. This month, over a year after his disappearance, China announced\u00a0the judiciary had sentenced Meng to 13 years in prison on nebulous corruption charges.",
            "RFA noted that several other observers of China\u2019s concentration camp projects warned that the Wuhan virus spreading in such a contained location could result in \u201cdisaster,\u201d speeding up China\u2019s systematic genocide campaign against the Uyghur people.",
            "Survivors of the camps have revealed that their primary objective appears to be indoctrination. Prisoners are forced to learn Mandarin and abandon the Uyghur language, give up their faith, and worship the Communist Party. Guards teach songs worshipping dictator Xi Jinping and praising the Party, and the few released from the prison are those who \u201cprove\u201d to authorities that they have internalized the indoctrination and will serve the Party loyally in the outside world.",
            "Slavery is also a key pillar of the concentration camp system. In October, Uyghur issues experts revealed evidence that prisoners at the camps were manufacturing baby clothes sold by a company that did business with the American chain store Costco, which cut ties with the company after activists revealed that the clothes in question were made by slaves in Xinjiang.",
            "China is \u201cturning its internment campaign into a business of oppression \u2026 they will be able to undercut global prices and turn \u2018Made in Xinjiang\u2019 into a multi-billion-dollar business model,\u201d Adrian Zenz, a non-resident senior fellow in China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, told the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.",

Bodies lie in the street or are being carried out of homes. A van holding eight body bags waits to transport the dead from the hospital to a crematorium. Lines of people snake through hospital wards awaiting testing and registration, each cough in the crowd eliciting an unconscious flinch. Dozens of others sit in a waiting room, hooked up to IV bags dangling incongruously from the ceiling like jellyfish floating in an aquarium.",
            "We hear the sobs of people standing over dying parents and loved ones lying lifeless on gurneys. People lean against the walls or lie in hallways, the dead lying on stretchers beside them covered with flowered comforters brought from home. Health-care workers all wear full hazmat suits, while regular people move in and out of hospitals protected only by paper face masks, all hiding behind a muffled anonymity. An eerie silence pervades, as though speech itself will spread the disease further.",
            "You don\u2019t have to look far to find the signs of a typically authoritarian response to the crisis. CCP officials weld doors shut to prevent those who have fallen ill from leaving their homes. Hospitals and clinics turn people away because they can\u2019t pay (despite official promises of free care), returning home to attend to themselves and their families or to succumb to the illness alone. And without approved diagnoses, these deaths will not be counted in official CCP statistics about the new disease.",
            "At just about the same moment Chen Guangcheng was writing those words, one of the citizen journalists he saluted for bravery, Chen Quishi, was thrown into \u201cquarantine\u201d and has been held incommunicado ever since.",

            "The events of the past 48 hours represent the largest protests in Hong Kong since the coronavirus outbreak forced locals to avoid large assemblies, making it difficult for pro-democracy protesters to gather and demand change. Hong Kong had experienced six months of protests urging the government to allow the direct election of lawmakers and to hold police accountable for violence against dissidents prior to China making the coronavirus outbreak public in January.",
            "Much of the violence appeared to have occurred in the neighborhoods of Mong Kok and Prince Edward. Protesters reportedly first organized to observe the six-month anniversary of a violent police attack on the protest movement in Prince Edward, leaving flowers for those allegedly killed on August 31, though no confirmation of any fatalities at the hands of police exists. Many reports do exist of injuries as a result of clashes with the police during that incident. While protesters insist some died during the August 31 protests, police also used them last week to arrest several prominent supporters of the protest movement, including media mogul and\u00a0Apple Daily publisher Jimmy Lai. Lai, a vocal anti-communist, became a regular fixture at Hong Kong\u2019s protests last year.",
            "Reports indicated that police organized at the location where peaceful pro-democracy protesters had agreed to meet on Saturday hours before their planned time and began to attack anyone who arrived to participate in the event. Police began hurling tear gas canisters at protesters to force them to disperse, dismantling the altar of flowers left to the casualties of the August protest. The police action triggered a violent response that reportedly included setting a Mass Transit Rail (MTR) station on fire. The protesters also appeared to be acting in defense of journalists, who police targeted with tear gas and pepper spray.",
            "Protesters complained that, while officers insist their use of tear gas and pepper spray is necessary to disperse crowds, they appear to use it to pack individuals onto small corners of sidewalks that make them easier targets \u2014 and make the crowds larger and more dangerous for all, not smaller.",

The Hong Kong government ultimately yielded to that demand, tabling the bill that would have allowed extraditions, but protesters continued to demand democratic reforms.

            "In the aftermath of the revelation that China identified a new, highly contagious virus in January, much of the energy of these protests shifted to condemning the Hong Kong government for not acting to close the border with China and for sending health workers into hospitals to handle contagious cases without the necessary protections. Hong Kong\u2019s health workers went on strike to demand full border closures \u2014 the government only shut down all but three points of entry \u2014 and subsequent protests against coronavirus treatment centers in residential neighborhoods have continued.",

            "Shanghai is about 500 miles from Wuhan and there is no clear connection between Ying and Hubei province. Ying is one of dictator Xi Jinping\u2019s closest allies, however, and Chinese state media applauded Ying and the new Wuhan party chair\u00a0Wang Zhonglin for being \u201cproblem-solvers who can make accurate decisions.\u201d",
            "Outgoing Hubei Party chief\u00a0Jiang Chaoliang is the most powerful person so far to face consequences from the newly discovered coronavirus outbreak, which has at press time been confirmed to have infected over 60,000 people and killed over 1,000, nearly all of them in China.",
            "The firing of Jiang and Wuhan Party leader\u00a0Ma Guoqiang occurred concurrently with the replacement of China\u2019s director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. Xia Baolong, another Xi loyalist with a record of specializing in Christian persecution, has taken over that office. Hong Kong has documented dozens of coronavirus cases amid a months-long popular push for autonomy from China.",

At press time, Shanghai has documented 315 cases of coronavirus and one death.",

As Hong Kong\u2019s ire has remained directed at the Hong Kong government for submitting to Beijing\u2019s wishes, rather than at Beijing itself, the Communist Party has apparently chosen not to remove Zhang from the public eye entirely.",
            "His replacement,\u00a0Xia Baolong, served as Xi Jinping\u2019s deputy and has led efforts by the Communist Party to persecute the growing numbers of converted Christians in the country. Xia pioneered the use of zoning and other urban ordinance restrictions to punish churches for placing crosses in public, or demolish crosses and churches that violated the alleged rules. His promotion has alarmed many in Hong Kong who see it as a response to the ongoing pro-democracy movement there.",
            "The replaced officials join several local Party authorities already demoted for allegedly failing to respond to the outbreak in time. Wuhan locals reported knowing of an illness spreading in the city in December and officials shut down a wild meat market believed to be the origin of the virus on January 1. Wuhan officials did not make the public aware of the threat, however, until January 20, allowing several high-risk mass assemblies to go on and likely helping the virus spread.",
            "Wuhan Mayor\u00a0Zhou Xianwang has said he kept the virus a secret because he does not have the authority, via communist law, to warn residents of a public health emergency without permission from superiors, likely those in Beijing.",

The patient was a 29-year-old man with a history of traveling to Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease outbreak. He died of pneumonia and tested HIV-positive, but testing for the Wuhan virus has not been conclusive.",

At this time there is no known protocol which we can follow to combat the disease. What we can do is to limit the people entering [the Philippines].

For example, on February 27, nine days after the Coronavirus was detected in Iran for the first time, the death rate was around 12% and on February 28 around 9%.

            "The unifying factor in these Communist Party screeds, as plainly stated by the People\u2019s Daily, is the allegation that critics of China\u2019s response to the virus \u201chave taken advantage of the epidemic to slander the Chinese government and attack China\u2019s political system.\u201d",
            "The People\u2019s Daily pushed back by arguing the United States did a worse job of controlling the H1N1 virus in 2009:",
            "The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 60.8 million Americans contracted the H1N1 virus. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, the virus led to more than 12,000 deaths in a population of 300 million, a number that is hardly on par with the medical standards of a developed nation.",
            "Additionally, CDC estimates that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from the H1N1 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.",
            "Well, at least they declared it a public health emergency. However, the US government clearly failed to take enough measures to control it.",
            "This was followed by the Communist Party\u2019s familiar lament that ordinary influenza outbreaks supposedly infect and kill more people than the Wuhan coronavirus, but no one makes a big deal about the flu, plus some carping about the disaster response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",
            "The People\u2019s Daily wrapped up by quoting the same politically useful statements from the World Health Organization (WHO) that Chinese propaganda repeats on a daily basis:",
            "Just like WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said in his speech: \u201cThere is a window of opportunity because of the strong measures China is taking at the epicenter, at the source.\u201d",
            "Facts and numbers have clearly displayed the truth: China\u2019s speed, scale, and efficiency all demonstrate the strengths of its system.",
            "US politicians should stop pointing figures at others, especially if the US government is unable to act in times of public emergency. At the very least, they can shut their mouths if they cannot provide actual help to the world.",
            "Another People\u2019s Daily article lamented that the U.S. is not doling out foreign aid quickly enough:",
            "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced recently on social media that Washington would offer up to $100 million to China and other countries affected by the coronavirus to combat its spread, saying \u201cThis commitment demonstrates strong U.S. leadership in response to the outbreak.\u201d",
            "However, when asked about the implementation of the fund at a news conference held on Feb.10 in Washington, James Richardson, director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources at the State Department, said the $100 million was just an upper limit.",
            "Except for some assigned projects to help Laos, he didn\u2019t disclose further details about the fund.",

            "However, people would question that the implementation of the assistance obviously doesn\u2019t match what Washington has promised. What\u2019s more, the delayed aid is also not convincing enough to back the \u201cstrong leadership\u201d claimed by the U.S. government.",
            "But then another state-run Chinese publication, the Global Times, accused the U.S. of racism for insinuating that China needs any help at all, tossing in the same H1Z1 figures quoted by the People\u2019s Daily to argue that America has no standing to criticize China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus:",
            "This double standard not only reflects the US stance toward China\u2019s efforts in combating the outbreak, but in other domains as well. This is partly related to so-called American exceptionalism, which presumes that US values, political system, and history are worthy of universal admiration. It indicates that the US is both destined and entitled to play a distinct role at the world stage. This provides the US with a pretext to promote its global hegemony, set double standards and meddle in internal affairs of other countries.",
            "When dealing with countries like China, whose ideology and political system are totally different from those in the West, the double standards imposed by the US tend to be more severe.",
            "As the world\u2019s only superpower, Washington is supposed to shoulder more responsibility during a global health emergency. It should be providing more health-care material aid and proactively leading or organizing international cooperation. At the very least, the US should maintain neutrality toward the outbreak and show sympathy toward the people suffering from the epidemic, rather than add insult to injury.",
            "The Global Times theorized that U.S. \u201cprejudice\u201d could be why it challenges the accuracy of coronavirus information released by China, speculated that offers of assistance could be a pretext for American troops to conduct \u201cmilitary missions to detect China\u2019s capabilities in biochemical research,\u201d muttered about links between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the military, and concluded by wondering if Washington isn\u2019t delivering all the help it was racist to offer because of President Trump\u2019s selfish and xenophobic \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.",
            "The dangerous thing about all this political spin is that it goes beyond the Chinese Communist Party nursing its wounded pride. The Chinese are desperate to get normal travel and commerce flowing again, no matter the risks posed to foreign populations by the Wuhan coronavirus.",
            "International organizations are reluctant to provoke Beijing\u2019s ire by openly accusing it of providing false information about the number of infections and deaths. China is trying to leverage that reluctance and force the rest of the world to embrace its political narratives about the epidemic, but the cold, hard truth is that most of the world knows it would be much safer to wait for independent confirmation that the epidemic really is receding.\u00a0",
            "At the moment, roughly ten percent of the immense Chinese population is living under some form of quarantine or lockdown. Reports of high-profile deaths continue to accumulate even as Chinese officials insist the situation is under control, and the deaths include a disturbing number of healthy young victims, not the ailing old people that are supposed to be most at risk.\u00a0",
            "The latest tragedy is a report on Tuesday that Chinese film director Chang Kai and his entire family in the city of Wuhan were wiped out by the coronavirus. Chang was 55 years old. He lived long enough to see his father and mother die, and write a letter to his friends that said, \u201cFarewell to those I love, and to those who loved me.\u201d",
            "The Chinese Communist Party can hurl all the insults it wants, but the world has good reason to doubt that the full story of the Wuhan coronavirus has been told, and good reason to believe the continued good health of foreigners is not at the top of the Party\u2019s list of priorities."

            "Health authorities in Hong Kong announced Monday that they have procured 500 electric trackers to place on individuals suspected of being infected with the new form of coronavirus originating in China last month.",
            "The Hong Kong government is ordering anyone residing in Hong Kong present in the city or returning to it after visiting Hubei province \u2013 whose capital, Wuhan, is the location where the virus is believed to have first jumped from animals to humans \u2013 in the last two weeks into quarantine at home. To ensure that no one violates the 14-day isolation period and puts others in the population at risk, officials will use wristbands to monitor their location.\nThe trackers will be tied to the wearer\u2019s smartphone via Bluetooth technology. The phone\u2019s GPS technology will provide the person\u2019s location \u2013 if the phone leaves the permitted area, or if the wristband reaches more than a 20-meter distance away from the phone, the government will consider the wearer in breach of the quarantine. Destroying the wristband or taking it off will also count as breaches.",
            "Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Information Officer Victor Lam debuted the wristbands in a press conference Monday, where he warned that violations found with the wristband could result in up to a six-month prison term or fined the equivalent of U.S. $644. He emphasized that the tags themselves do not have GPS technology, so the government will not monitor the wearer\u2019s every move, providing a minimum of privacy. He also noted that the government will soon count on another 1,000 wristbands to use similarly.",
            "The move is part of a growing response to the coronavirus outbreak currently ravaging China and threatening the rest of the world. The Chinese government revealed on January 20 \u2013 nearly a month after secretly alerting the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 that it had identified a never-before-seen coronavirus spreading in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. China shut down the wild meat market where the virus is believed to have originated on January 1, and local officials instituted a lockdown in Wuhan, preventing entry or exit and stopping mass transit, a week after the announcement of the new virus.",
            "Hong Kong has identified 15 cases of novel coronavirus as of Monday, according to the Asian outlet Coconuts. The city has identified potentially hundreds of cases, increasingly running out of spaces to isolate them and prevent the outbreak from growing, hence the introduction of at-home measures.",
            "Isolation is especially important in light of authorities warning on Sunday that they may have identified a case of coronavirus passed from human to human within Hong Kong \u2013 rather than the case of a person returning from Wuhan already carrying it.",
            "\u201cHong Kong can become another Wuhan,\u201d Yuen Kwok-yung, a University of Hong Kong microbiologist, said on Sunday, according to local broadcaster RTHK. Yuen suggested increased border controls to keep carriers out of the city, noting that Guangdong, the Chinese province that borders Hong Kong, is one of the most affected by the outbreak.",
            "The individual identified as a potential human-to-human case is a patient that has reportedly not traveled outside Hong Kong within a time frame that would have made it possible to get the virus from someone abroad.",
            "Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has limited the flow of travelers from China, but refused to shut down the border completely, triggering widespread protests and a general strike of Hong Kong healthcare workers at a pivotal time in fighting the outbreak. Lam has taken to shutting border crossings piecemeal, and on Monday announced that all but three crossings will remain open. One of them is Hong Kong\u2019s international airport, where government officials insist they have installed enough security measures to catch incoming cases.",

            "Many in Hong Kong, already protesting Lam\u2019s close ties to the Communist Party of China for half a year before the outbreak began, have not accepted her explanation. On Monday, RTHK reported that dozens of Hong Kong residents took to the streets during their lunch breaks from work to demand a complete closure of Hong Kong\u2019s borders to China. The crowd, some chanting \u201cclose the border, say no to China,\u201d sang Hong Kong democracy protest albums and demanded an end to the closures until police threatened them with potential action in light of them being \u201csuspected of taking part in an unlawful assembly,\u201d RTHK noted.",
            "Also on Monday, thousands of healthcare workers began their strike against the government. As they are the first to interact with potential coronavirus cases, an open border is riskiest for them.",
            "\u201cIf there is no full border closure, there won\u2019t be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms, to combat the outbreak\u201d, Winnie Yu,\u00a0the chairman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, told reporters. The first day of striking would only include non-essential healthcare workers, though that may change in the near future.",
            "\u201cWe reiterate\u2026 we hospital staff are being forced into taking this desperate move of taking industrial action by those in power,\u201d Yu said. \u201cWe welcome the government at any time, to join in open talks with the Hospital Authority to give concrete responses to our demands, to resolve this current impasse.\u201d",

            "Huanggang, a city near Wuhan that implemented one of the first lockdowns against the new strain of coronavirus identified in China this month, reportedly fired the head of its health commission on Thursday, the first local official stripped of his title.",
            "The ouster follows a week of growing tensions between Beijing and local officials in and around Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, as Communist Party leaders and state media outlets attempt to redirect public outrage away from dictator Xi Jinping and towards dispensible local officials.",
            "Subtle signs of the lack of confidence began Sunday when Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, asked the public for an apology over the secretive government response to the viral outbreak but blamed higher-ranking federal officials for withholding key information too long, saying he did not have authority to reveal public health data without approval from the Party.",
            "Zhou offered to resign during that press conference, but as of press time remains in power. The same cannot be said for Tang Zhihong, the head of Huanggang\u2019s health commission. The\u00a0South China Morning Post, citing the local Communist Party committee, said that the decision from above to remove Tang followed a painful interview broadcast on state media in which Tang was unable to tell reporters how many open beds the city had allocated for potentially infected patients or if the city had the resources to test all those who sought to know if they were carrying the new coronavirus.",
            "Huanggang is a city in Hubei province about an hour and a half from Wuhan. While its population is about 6 million people, slightly smaller than New York City, it is dwarfed by the 11 million living in Wuhan. Locals often commute to work from Huanggang to Wuhan. The\u00a0Morning Post noted that, at 324 confirmed cases as of Thursday, Huanggang has been more directly affected by the outbreak than any other city except Wuhan.",
            "Tang\u2019s reported inability to say if Huanggang had enough test kits available to document coronavirus cases follows a week in which a growing number of reports from anonymous sources on the ground in Hubei province suggested that the Communist Party is deliberately refusing to test individuals who show clear signs of the coronavirus, thus deflating the total number of cases and making the outbreak appear less severe. Chinese government-controlled media revealed that Wuhan does not have enough testing kits openly, but insider reports from the city indicate that hospitals are turning people away unless they have government permission for a coronavirus test, likely resulting in thousands of unidentified cases.",
            "As of Thursday, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have documented 8,243 cases of the new coronavirus and 171 deaths, the latter all in China. Cases of the virus have officially affected every province of China and neighboring countries such as Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and elsewhere. Outside of Asia, Italy, France, Canada, and the United States have documented cases, among others.",
            "The virus causes several respiratory symptoms common to influenza and other viral infections, including fevers, coughing, difficulty breathing, and body aches. The virus appears to rapidly trigger pneumonia, endangering the lives of many patients. It belongs to the same category of virus as the one responsible for Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people in 2003 and also originated in China.",
            "Chinese authorities notified the WHO on December 31 that they had identified a viral infection of unknown origin. On January 1, Wuhan officials shut down a wild game and seafood market believed to be where a person first ingested the virus, likely through wild meat. It took Chinese officials another 20 days to tell the world that they had evidence of a growing outbreak and Beijing only shared the new viral genome sequence on January 20. The weekend before, locals reported that the government staged a banquet for 130,000 people; sharing food in contained spaces increases the virus\u2019s ability to spread.",
            "Mayor Zhou expressed frustration with this secrecy on Sunday, blaming the Communist Party for not allowing him to be open about the situation.",
            "\u201cOn one hand, we did not reveal [information] in time; on the other, we did not use effective information to improve our work to a satisfactory level,\u201d Zhou\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cRegarding the untimely disclosure, [I] hope everyone can understand. [Coronavirus] is a contagious disease. Contagious diseases have relevant law and information needs to be disclosed according to law.\u201d",
            "The\u00a0Global Times, a government newspaper, called Zhou\u2019s press conference a \u201cdisaster,\u201d couching it in reporting on the alleged social media response to his remarks. Communist Party officials control and censor all social media, stifling any dissent they do not specifically choose to leave public.

",
            "The government believes up to 60 percent of South Korea\u2019s 4,335 coronavirus cases can be traced to the Shincheonji Church.",
            "The church, which has been denounced as a cult with apocalyptic beliefs revolving around Lee as a messiah who will take them to paradise on Judgment Day, has about 230,000 members. Almost 9,000 of them are currently exhibiting symptoms of the coronavirus.\u00a0",
            "The infection appears to have been spread by an elderly member who visited the Chinese city of Wuhan, refused to be hospitalized when she became ill, and contaminated fellow worshipers at four church meetings, including one in Daegu, South Korea\u2019s fourth-largest city. Church members then began spreading the disease through the South Korean population. Shincheonji worship services are notoriously overcrowded.",
            "The South Korean government charged Shincheonji leaders with being slow to cooperate with health officials. Their secretive conduct has been cited as a violation of the National Infectious Disease and Control Act, and since the coronavirus has killed at least 26 South Koreans so far, the government wants them investigated for murder.",

He has been dogged by lawsuits, protest rallies and allegations of preaching heresy, splitting apart families, as well as going after rival churches. He has survived them all, commanding a messianic charisma over the 245,000 followers who he says the church has in South Korea and abroad.",
            "Until now, Mr. Lee\u2019s Shincheonji has been one of the fastest-growing religious sects in South Korea. He has employed an aggressive proselytizing program that has unnerved mainstream Christian religions who liken the church to a cult. He has often staged large-scale outdoor events that remind critics of massive propaganda rallies in North Korea.",
            "Like North Korea, the church has its own calendar, counting the years from the day Mr. Lee founded it in 1984. It hosts its own \u201cOlympiad,\u201d filling a stadium with worshipers from around the world. It features military-style honor guards, taekwondo exhibitions and other group performances similar to North Korea\u2019s Mass Games. Often dressed in snow white and carrying his trademark hand-held folding fan, Mr. Lee likes to snap a military salute to his adoring crowds.",
            "\u201cShincheonji has been growing rapidly despite the persecutions\u201d from the mainstream Christian churches, Mr. Lee said in an interview with the newspaper Kyeonggi Ilbo last June. \u201cWhy? Because we have a doctrine. We are not a traditional church.\u201d",
            "As the coronavirus spread, health officials became so desperate to track down its secretive and potentially infectious members that they resorted to sending text messages to the public asking for their help. The sect denounced these efforts as a form of \u201cwitch-hunting\u201d and said its members were reluctant to turn themselves in to the authorities because they feared persecution. At one government clinic in Daegu, an official became sick with the coronavirus and then revealed he had secretly been a member of Shincheonji all along.",
            "The mayor of Daegu accused Shincheonji of submitting an inaccurate list of members to health officials, as did a civic group called the National Shincheonji Victims Coalition, whose ranks include many former members of the sect and their families. After these complaints were leveled, Shincheonji gave another 65,000 names of \u201ctrainees\u201d to the government and said it misidentified some of its 40,000 members who live outside South Korea."

            "The article begins by attacking President Trump for disagreeing with Vice President Mike Pence about whether to evacuate passengers off a cruise chip near California, the Grand Princess,\u00a0on which coronavirus had broken out.",
            "The president,\u00a0Politico reports, wanted to keep the passengers on the ship, though he ultimately deferred to Pence as leader of the nation\u2019s coronavirus fight.",
            "What Diamond does not note is that\u00a0Politico \u2014 among others \u2014 devoted extensive coverage to criticisms of the decision to evacuate Americans last month from another cruise ship, the\u00a0Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined in Japan. That is the context in which the administration is making similar decisions.",
            "The fact that President Donald Trump is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn\u2019t suggests that there is something other than reasonable criticism on offer.",
            "Politico faults the Trump administration for \u201cfailing to secure enough testing to head off a coronavirus outbreak in the United States,\u201d a claim that \u2014 if true \u2014 would be laid at the feet of the CDC. But while admitting that,\u00a0Politico\u00a0uses \u201ccurrent and former officials\u201d to say that Trump\u2019s \u201catmosphere\u201d at the White House is really to blame.",
            "The \u201catmosphere,\u201d\u00a0Politico alleges, is one that discourages officials from giving the president bad news. But that fails to distinguish between how the government functions under Trump from how it functions under anyone else.",
            "(There were similar allegations of a bad \u201catmosphere\u201d during the Obama administration when it came to intelligence reports about the fight against the so-called \u201cIslamic State.\u201d An inspector general\u2019s report later found that there had been no deliberate attempts by the Obama White House to distort the intelligence, but that a perception that the administration did not want to hear \u201cbad news\u201d led intelligence analysts to self-censor in some of their reporting.)",
            "Politico also faults Trump for failing to appoint \u201ca sole leader to fight the outbreak, as President Barack Obama did with Ebola in 2014.\u201d The implication is that Obama did a good job with Ebola.",
            "But the Obama administration was perceived at the time to have bungled the response, and only belatedly put Ron Klain, a political staffer with\u00a0no relevant experience, in charge.\nDiamond also criticizes Trump for replacing his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, with Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), in the midst of a crisis. While it is not clear that had anything to do with coronavirus, one of the hallmarks of Trump\u2019s administration has been the swift removal of people perceived to be doing less than the best job possible.",
            "It may not be how \u201cpoliticos\u201d think Washington ought to function, but it is how the business world works \u2014 and it is part of the reason Americans elected Trump. (Arguably, it has worked, and is working.)",
            "Politico\u2018s latest criticism is indistinguishable from hundreds of others that have appeared in the mainstream media since the president took office, driven by unnamed sources with apparent axes to grind and vague complaints about the president\u2019s management style.",
            "In a similar vein, the\u00a0Washington Post accused the Trump administration Saturday of \u201csquander[ing] time\u201d in the fight against the virus, after even the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine said that early travel restrictions \u201cmay have helped slow the spread of the virus.\u201d The\u00a0Post\u2018s sources: \u201c16 current and former administration officials.\u201d\nIn an atmosphere where Trump\u2019s critics have a strong incentive to a) inflame the crisis, and b) blame it on him, it is remarkable how little the method of criticism has changed.",

            "The most likely explanation for the origin of the coronavirus outbreak relates to a biological weapons laboratory in Wuhan, China, said Steven Mosher, expert on China and author of\u00a0Bully of Asia: Why China\u2019s Dream is the New Threat to World Order.",
            "Mosher shared his estimation on Tuesday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, drawing on his Saturday-published New York Post column,\u00a0titled\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t buy China\u2019s story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe evidence has been piling up for weeks, now,\u201d said Mosher. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching this very closely. I knew back in January when the first reports came out of China that they\u2019d been hiding it for weeks. I know that they\u2019ve had a bioweapons program in place in China for decades. I know that they have only one level 4 laboratory in China, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, a city with \u2026 probably 15 million people.\u201d",
            "LISTEN:",
            "",
            "Mosher continued, \u201cBut then we have new evidence. At an emergency meeting in Beijing held on the 14th of this month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u2014 I might call him dictator Xi, except Michael Bloomberg would object, but he is the dictator \u2014 he held a meeting and he spoke about the need to set up a system to prevent epidemics in the future by increasing lab safety. He said laboratory safety is a national security issue.\u201d",
            "Mosher went on, \u201cNow, if that isn\u2019t clear enough, the next day, the very next day, [the] Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive, and its title, it\u2019s a little bit long, but pay attention to this, is \u2018instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.\u2019 Wait a minute, wait a minute, \u2018instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in labs that handle viruses like the novel coronavirus\u2019 \u2014 the one virus causing the epidemic \u2014 and you mean to suggest, China, that maybe your lab\u2019s biosecurity management wasn\u2019t very good and that this virus actually escaped from the lab in Wuhan, and now you\u2019re playing catch up after the cat is out of the bag, after the genie is out of the bottle, after the horse has left the barn?\u201d",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s what it certainly sounds like to me,\u201d assessed Mosher. \u201cIt sounds like they have a real problem keeping dangerous pathogens and test tubes where they belong and I\u2019ll tell you this: we know that there have been many, many leaks from China\u2019s biotechnology labs in the past their bioresearch labs are leaky.\u201d",
            "Mosher remarked, \u201cIn fact, in Beijing a few years ago, they leaked the SARS virus \u2014 that deadly SARS virus. SARS is sudden acute respiratory syndrome. [SARS] killed ten percent of the people that it was communicated to \u2014 at least twice out of a lab in Beijing a few years ago. We know they have a problem with containment of these dangerous pathogens.\u201d",
            "Mosher stated, \u201cWe know they\u2019re working on them, tinkering with them, doing genetic engineering on them. In fact, this Ministry of Science and Technology now wants to strengthen biosecurity management, [and] has been funding research on coronaviruses for the last ten years. They\u2019ve been taking out segments of the coronavirus RNA and replacing it with other segments from HIV and other things.\u00a0That\u2019s in open source virology research publications.\u201d ",
            "Chinese researchers may have sold infected laboratory animals used in virology research at a meat market, noted Mosher.",
            "\u201cSo connect the dots, put everything together,\u201d urged Mosher. \u201cThey were doing research on dangerous coronaviruses in the lab, and it got out of the lab. How did it get out of the lab? Well, this is interesting, too, because you might think that the most likely scenario is a researcher in the lab was careless and got some of the virus on his clothing or actually got infected with the disease then went out into public and infected the public, but there\u2019s another vector. And the other vector is this: that sometimes in China researchers who are buying expensive lab animals, after they get done researching the lab animals, maybe infecting them with coronavirus, they then, if the lab animals are still alive, they then take them to make a little extra money and sell them at the local fresh meat market where they are slaughtered and wind up in someone\u2019s stomach.\u201d",
            "Mosher added, \u201cNow that\u2019s hard to believe, but it does happen. There are researchers in prison in China today who have done that and who have been caught. The fact is Chinese Communist Party officials try to monetize anything they\u2019re in control of, and if you give a Chinese party official a bunch of free lab animals, he\u2019s going to use them for his research and then, in some cases, instead of cremating them like they\u2019re supposed to, they then turn around and sell them on the meat market.\u201d",
            "\u201cThere was a meeting in Beijing by the head of the National Health Service of China a few weeks ago, and he instructed [health workers] in all the provinces, cities, and towns of China that the first priority was politics, the second priority was safety, and the third priority was curing the sick,\u201d recalled Mosher.",
            "China\u2019s quarantine measures are \u201cmore like the guillotine,\u201d determined Mosher. \u201cIt\u2019s more like just amputation, amputating these people out of society, so they won\u2019t infect others.\u201d",
            "Mosher praised the Trump administration\u2019s policies towards addressing the coronavirus threat.",
            "\u201cWe took action faster than almost any country,\u201d he said, highlighting President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban foreigners who had recently traveled to China from entering the U.S. He added, \u201cPresident Trump set up a task force with the leading epidemiologists, the leading virologists, [and] the leading figures in the field and he\u2019s giving them all the resources that they need.\u201d",
            "Mosher concluded, \u201cIf there\u2019s an administration that is capable of handling this kind of crisis, it\u2019s the Trump administration.\u201d",

            "China logged the deadliest day on record on Wednesday since the novel coronavirus outbreak afflicting the nation began in December, breaking a record set only on Tuesday and defying clamor from state propaganda outlets last week that the rates of infection and death were declining.",
            "At press time, Chinese and global health officials have confirmed 28,396 cases of the coronavirus, identified only on January 20, and 566 patients dying from the disease. Only three of these have died outside of China. Officials also claimed that 1,341 people have recovered from coronavirus infection, suggesting that a significant number of those infected do overcome the illness.",
            "The\u00a0South China Morning Post noted on Thursday that Chinese officials documented 73 deaths between Wednesday and Thursday, the highest recorded in one day. That number was 64 deaths on Tuesday, the previous record.",
            "The number of documented cases on Wednesday fell compared to Tuesday, however.",
            "\u201cThe last time the rise in new infection figures slowed was January 28, after the daily increase in confirmed cases again rose on Tuesday \u2013 3,887 in China, of which 3,156 were in Hubei,\u201d the Post\u00a0noted.",
            "Among the new patients are newborn infants whose mothers are carriers of the virus, suggesting that the virus may infect in utero. Doctors have emphasized the potential that the children contracted the virus after being born, as the first patient tested positive for the virus 30 hours after being born, so no confirmation exists yet that the new infection route in the mother\u2019s womb exists.",
            "The current official mortality rate of the virus is hovering around two percent and includes a significant percentage of older patients and at-risk patients with prior illnesses. This number may be significantly inflated by the fact that Chinese officials did not tell health workers in Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, that the virus was contagious through the breath of a carrier, so hospitals did not isolate potential carriers, spreading the disease to people already hospitalized. The Chinese government also held a banquet for 130,000 people the weekend before it announced it had identified the virus, targeting older \u201cempty nest\u201d residents of Wuhan.",
            "\u201cBe cautious and say no to family banquet amid coronavirus outbreak: a family reunion among 9 people in Nanjing, East China\u2019s Jiangsu, contaminated 8 while 1 initially became a virus spreader,\u201d the Chinese state propaganda outlet\u00a0Global Times warned on Thursday, over two weeks after the state-sponsored banquet.",
            "The\u00a0Global Times also reported on Thursday that \u201ca type of herbal soup\u201d has allegedly cured 90 percent of coronavirus patients who drank it and that the Chinese government is issuing awards to doctors who initially responded to the outbreak.",
            "While the government hands out rewards, locals in Wuhan report \u201csevere\u201d hospital bed shortages despite the alleged construction of an entirely new hospital in Wuhan in little over a week.",
            "\u201cDespite authorities building a hospital from scratch and converting public buildings to accommodate thousands of extra patients, there was still a \u2018severe\u2019 lack of beds, said Hu Lishan, an official in Wuhan,\u201d the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) reported. \u201cThere was also a shortage of \u2018equipment and materials,\u2019 he told reporters, adding that officials were looking to convert other hotels and schools in the city into treatment centres.\u201d",
            "Hong Kong has documented 22 cases of the virus so far, a number that increased by one on Wednesday. The outbreak has triggered a city-wide health workers strike, attracting thousands of doctors, nurses, medical assistants, and others, who are demanding that the Hong Kong government shut its border entirely with China. The health workers are also demanding more support in the form of medical equipment like face masks and other sanitary items, complaining that the open border allows Chinese who do not trust the crumbling healthcare infrastructure of their country to flood Hong Kong\u2019s hospitals, putting strain on the local healthcare system. The health workers have been on strike since Monday.",
            "The Hong Kong government has refused to shut the border. Instead, the government announced on Wednesday that it would require anyone entering Hong Kong through China to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine to prevent them from potentially spreading the virus. Doctors believe that patients carrying the virus will show symptoms within this two-week period.",
            "The accelerating death rate calls into question the Chinese National Health Commission\u2019s insistence that the rate of infection in the country was declining last week, suggesting that the viral outbreak had peaked. Last Wednesday, the Global Times\u00a0noted that, between that Tuesday and Wednesday, the number of cases documented had slightly declined, calling it a \u201cgleam of hope.\u201d At the time of publication of the article, widespread reports from individuals in Wuhan and health workers there suggested that the Chinese government was deliberately failing to test individuals exhibiting the tell-tale fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing associated with the new coronavirus. Anonymous medical staff in Wuhan told various outlets that their supply of testing kits to confirm illnesses was limited and the government only allowed testing on pre-approved patients, resulting in many who went to hospitals asking to be tested being turned down.",
            "Chinese officials have also been extremely secretive about the cases of coronavirus documented\u00a0in Xinjiang, China\u2019s westernmost province located hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Xinjiang is home to a complex system of hundreds of concentration camps designed to indoctrinate, sterilize, enslave, and use for organ harvesting millions of Muslims, most belonging to the regions Uyghur ethnic minority. Survivors of the camps report\u00a0people dying regularly and extremely unhygienic conditions in the camps that make prisoners particularly vulnerable to an outbreak of a deadly virus. Officials there are considering the condition and number of cases of coronavirus in the region a \u201cstate secret,\u201d leading many to question the authenticity of the number of cases there.",

I hope that it\u2019s going to be a very little problem, but we have to work together. Instead, she wants to do the same thing with Crying Chuck Schumer. He goes out and says the president only asks for $2.5 million. He should have $8.5 billion. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever been told we should take more.

            "Xi has largely remained outside of the public eye since Chinese officials revealed the outbreak in late January, about a month after locals in the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan, reported they began hearing of an illness rapidly spreading. His tour of Beijing comes weeks after Premier Li Keqiang, his second-in-command, toured Wuhan itself.",
            "Uncorroborated reports from Wuhan \u2013 and video allegedly being smuggled out of the locked-down city of 11 million people \u2013 suggest authorities there going to extreme measures to isolate individuals suspected of carrying the virus, including bolting down and welding doors. Multiple reports have also indicated that the government is deliberately underreporting cases by making it difficult for \u201cunapproved\u201d patients with coronavirus symptoms to be tested and confirmed as carriers.",
            "As of Monday, the Chinese government and World Health Organization (WHO) have identified 40,627 cases of novel coronavirus worldwide. Another 910 have been confirmed to have died from coronavirus-related pneumonia and infection, only two of them outside of China. Most of the victims who died are considered higher-risk patients, seniors and individuals with preexisting conditions. At least one prominent case, however, was of a young, healthy man: Dr. Li Wenliang, a Wuhan medical professional who posted warnings about the virus online before Beijing had confirmed its existence, resulting in police apprehending him and forcing him to sign a humiliating apology for disturbing \u201cpublic order.\u201d Li, age 34, died last week after contracting the virus himself, raising questions about the conditions surrounding his death and the potential danger of the virus.",
            "The novel coronavirus, publicly identified as never-before-seen on January 20, triggered fevers, coughs, body aches, and difficulty breathing in most patients. In some, the infection advances to potentially fatal pneumonia.",
            "China\u2019s state propaganda outlets posted multiple photos of Xi Jinping visiting Beijing neighborhoods, wearing a sanitary face mask and speaking to both health professionals and Communist Party members responsible for controlling mobility in communities. Chinese media also recorded Xi having his temperature taken, an attempt to show that he, too, was following health officials\u2019 safeguards.",

The only major coronavirus-related appeared Xi had made before Monday was a meeting with WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last month, also an official state visit in Beijing. That meeting occurred three days after the Chinese government announced to the world it had identified and sequenced the genome of the new coronavirus.",

            "Here are five specific reasons to chill out.",
            "1. Coronavirus is a familiar illness, and not as bad as others. It is from the SARS family \u2014 and less deadly. As\u00a0Ha\u2019aretz noted, \u201cthe mortality rate from the current disease ranges from 0.5 to 2 percent, and is significantly lower than the mortality rate from the 2002 SARS outbreak (9.5 percent) and much lower than the 2012 SARS outbreak (34.4 percent). It may even be close to the mortality rate from an ordinary flu outbreak in the United States.\u201d",
            "2. The U.S. response has been exceptionally good. There have only been 16 cases thus far, none deadly. President Donald Trump bought precious time by stopping travel to China last month \u2014 a step critics said was overly drastic. Democrats are screaming about funding and staff cuts that never actually happened. The latest outrage: the White House is controlling the message. As they should! The people in lab coats are not always good communicators.",
            "3. We are going to have a vaccine soon. There are private companies in the U.S. and around the world racing to develop a vaccine \u2014 not just because of the urgent public health need, but because whoever finds it first stands to make a lot of money. (This is where the profit motive, and the pharmaceutical industry, are so crucial \u2014 contrary to what Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and other Democrats running for president have been saying about them.)",
            "4. China is going to be all right. The number of cases in China sounds large \u2014 until you consider the size of China. True, the Chinese government has been duplicitous about coronavirus, as it is about everything. (Amartya Sen famously observed that India, unlike China, has never suffered famine because India has a free press.) And U.S. firms are learning a long-overdue lesson about the risks of investing there. But China will eventually pull through.",
            "5. The same people who want you to panic about coronavirus want you to panic about everything. The news business thrives on chaos. In addition, the media want to destroy Trump, which is why they spread the Russia collusion hoax. Coronavirus is not a hoax, but pundits should be asked if they cared enough about flu \u2014 which kills far more people \u2014 to get their shot this year. If not, ignore them. Remember to wash your hands, and stay cool.",

In January, the WHO director-general said the organization \u201copposes any restrictions for travel and trade\u201d against China. The WHO as an organization has urged caution in limiting the mass transit of people worldwide.",
            "\u201cEvidence on travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic for more than 24 hours shows that such measures may have a public health rationale at the beginning of the containment phase of an outbreak, as they may allow affected countries to implement sustained response measures, and non-affected countries to gain time to initiate and implement effective preparedness measures,\u201d the WHO noted in its Tuesday report on the outbreak. \u201cSuch restrictions, however, need to be short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.\u201d",

I just think that we, of any country, are going to be in as good a shape to deal with it. And it\u2019ll play itself out.

            "According to an Al-Monitor report on Wednesday, the IRGC\u2019s claims fit neatly into regime propaganda about \u201castonishing the world\u201d by beating everyone else to a cure. Iranian health officials appear not to know what the IRGC is talking about, but they also have not called its leaders out as liars:",
            "A medical research center affiliated with Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says it is testing a vaccine that promises to eradicate the killer coronavirus. According to Brig. Gen. Alireza Jalali, the president of Baqiatollah Medical Sciences University, the vaccine is awaiting permits from Iran\u2019s Food and Drug Organization to enter the clinical phase.",
            "No further details have been released on the vaccine. But in a statement March 4, the Food and Drug Organization \u201cstrongly denied\u201d all recent \u201creports and rumors\u201d on social media that had claimed a breakthrough in the fight against the virus. Still, the organization, which has the final authority on the production and distribution of medicines in Iran, did not make specific reference to the IRGC announcement.",

Among other obvious deficiencies, the regime has stopped reporting new cases and deaths from the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Qom:",
            "Observers outside Iran including researchers in the United States and Europe agree that after several days of denial and playing down the number of those inflicted with the virus, Iran has started to announce more realistic figures since Tuesday that give a clearer picture of the outbreak\u2019s dimension. However, there is likely to be a gap between real figures and what is being announced.",

Qasem Soleimani,\u00a0killed by a U.S. airstrike in January while organizing terrorist activity in Iraq. During these remarks, Salami said the coronavirus epidemic could be the result of an \u201cAmerican biological invasion\u201d launched against China.

            "The World Health Organization (WHO), which has been criticized for obsequious behavior towards China while the coronavirus epidemic was spreading from Wuhan, chose this moment to bizarrely praise Iran for doing a great job of containing the disease \u2013 and, as with China, the Iranian regime used state media to capitalize on the propaganda opportunity provided by WHO.

That plan, the newspaper continued, would consist of expanding the ability of Cuban agents at ports of entry to monitor those entering the country. Doctors would also be tasked with isolating and identifying cases of respiratory infections that may be coronavirus cases; the virus causes symptoms common with many other respiratory diseases such as influenza and the common cold, which is also a type of coronavirus.",

The column also criticized those seeking stronger American sanctions on Cuba given the government\u2019s routine human rights abuses against pro-democracy dissidents, applauding the Cuban people for allegedly sharing the little they have.",

Yet much concern exists that the virus may soon surface in Latin America\u2019s most vulnerable countries: Cuba and its socialist allies, Venezuela and Nicaragua. All have close ties to the communist government in China and maintain regular contact with Chinese officials. China is the origin nation of the new coronavirus, first documented in the city of Wuhan and now present in every province of one of the world\u2019s largest countries.",
            "Cuba is one of the few Latin American countries to formally sign onto China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), initially promoted as an infrastructure plan to rebuild the ancient Silk Road connecting China to western Europe. China has since expanded the plan to infrastructure projects all over the planet on dubious claims that Latin America and Africa were also once part of the ancient Silk Road.",
            "The BRI consists largely of China issuing predatory loans to developing countries that those nations then invest in paying China to build new transportation infrastructure. In Cuba, that has manifested itself in the construction of a Chinese-built railway connecting Havana to Santiago de Cuba, the largest city in the east of the country.",
            "\u201cAs socialist countries, China and Cuba are good friends, comrades, and brothers,\u201d dictator Xi Jinping said of Cuba in November 2018, during D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s visit to Beijing to sign onto BRI.\u00a0\u201cChinese people will never forget that Cuba, led by Comrade\u00a0Fidel Castro, was the first nation in the western hemisphere to forge diplomatic ties with China 58 years ago.\u201d",

            "Virus researchers at universities estimate the true number of people infected with a newly discovered coronavirus in China eclipses the Communist Party\u2019s nearly 5,000-person estimate and that as many as 40,000 may be carrying it, reports revealed on Tuesday.",
            "Locals in Wuhan, China, have told multiple media outlets they began to be aware of a respiratory sickness spreading in the city of 11 million people in December. Communist authorities alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) that they believed they had identified a new virus on December 31, then closed the wild game and seafood market believed to have been ground zero of the first infection on January 1. Yet authorities did not tell the public of the discovery of a new virus until January 20, and reports suggest they did not alert doctors and other health workers to isolate people potentially carrying it, exposing hospital patients to widespread contagion.",
            "At press time, the Chinese regime and the WHO have confirmed 4,682 cases of coronavirus worldwide, including six in North America and 106 deaths, all in China. Chinese state media have also identified the youngest known carrier, an 11-month-old child in southern Guangdong, the province that borders Hong Kong.",
            "Experts at Northeastern University estimated on Tuesday that the number was closer to 25,000 than 5,000. At the University of Hong Kong, where the medical school demanded \u201cdraconian measures\u201d to stop the disease from spreading, researchers put the number of people currently infected in China at over 40,000.",
            "Given that even Chinese researchers agree the virus incubates for about 14 days, and may potentially be contagious at that point even in people who do not show symptoms, means \u201cit\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to end the next week or the next month,\u201d\u00a0said Alessandro Vespignani, a professor at Northeastern University, according to Hong Kong\u2019s RTHK broadcaster.\u00a0Vespignani said his team believes 25,000 people in China are carrying the coronavirus.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get to twice or three times as much [as the official estimate], even just in the city of Wuhan,\u201d Vespignani explained. \u201cIf we start to have other larger areas affected, then those numbers are going to be much, much bigger.\u201d",
            "Gabriel Leung, who runs the University of Hong Kong Medical School, told reporters that about 44,000 people in Wuhan, not counting the rest of China, are probably carrying the virus as of Saturday and that the number of infected people has been doubling every six days \u2013 meaning the number, according to his estimates, is inching towards 100,000. Leung also reached the number 25,000, but said this was likely the number of people exhibiting symptoms. Symptoms of the novel virus include fever, difficulty breathing, and coughing that has in many cases led to life-threatening pneumonia.",
            "Leung predicted that the outbreak would continue into the summer, perhaps starting to ease around June or July as the virus makes its way through every possible person. Viral outbreaks typically ease when either doctors introduce a vaccine that inoculates people who have not been infected, or when the virus has contaminated everyone.",
            "These independent estimates of how long it will take for the outbreak to subside differ significantly from what is coming out of Beijing and, if true, would confirm reports from those on the ground in Wuhan that doctors do not have the ability, or authority, to test all those who arrive at hospitals with symptoms, thus significantly bringing down the official tally.",
            "The head of the Communist Party\u2019s special panel to address the coronavirus crisis, Zhong Nanshan, was quoted in state propaganda outlet Xinhua saying that the government believed the outbreak would peak within 7-10 days, then start subsiding.",
            "\u201cSo far, no medication has been developed to specifically target the virus, but scientists and medical workers have explored many ways. As great improvement has also been made in life-support systems, the fatality rate is expected to drop further,\u201d Zhong said, according to Xinhua.",
            "Chinese officials have admitted to not doing enough to contain the virus in Wuhan in the early days after confirmation, but before Beijing told the public. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, said in a press conference Friday that 5 million people freely left Wuhan before the city instituted a lockdown to keep the virus from spreading. Zhou offered to resign, but also blamed higher-ranking Communist Party officials for the city\u2019s secrecy, insisting that he could not publicly reveal details of the viral outbreak without permission from higher-ups.",
            "Despite the failed attempts to contain the virus, WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus applauded the Party while in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday, appearing alongside Chinese dictator Xi Jinping.",
            "\u201cThe WHO speaks highly of China\u2019s major role in and great contribution to the cause of global public health, and is ready to further conduct strategic cooperation with China,\u201d Ghebreyesus said, according to Xinhua.",
            "\u201cThe Chinese government has always adopted an open, transparent and responsible attitude to timely release of information on the epidemic, domestically and to other countries,\u201d Xi Jinping said during that meeting. Ghebreyesus did not challenge the assumption.",

As a result, despite its proximity to China and documented coronavirus cases, the WHO is not sharing any data on the virus, helpful information and new developments, or humanitarian aid with Taiwan. The United Nations insists that it is communicating with China, which has no information about Taiwan, on the situation in the country and sending aid to China to be distributed to Taiwan.",

Only candidates who vow to bolster the current repressive regime can appear on ballots.",

This is the lowest number of voters since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, something Rahmani Fazli insisted was \u201cquite acceptable\u201d given growing concerns that Tehran has no control over the spread of the novel Wuhan coronavirus in the country, a virus considered highly contagious even among patients showing no symptoms.",

The Iranian government shot a Ukrainian airliner out of the sky in January, allegedly a mistake occurring while Iran shot over a dozen ballistic missiles at American targets in Iraq. The hundreds of deaths Iran\u2019s military caused triggered widespread protests against the regime, which Rahmani Fazli of course dubbed \u201criots.\u201d The interior minister attempted to claim that fear of being caught in a violent opposition assembly, not participating in a boycott, is what kept voters at home.",

            "Italy is expecting to lose at least \u20ac5 billion in tourism over fears of the coronavirus outbreak, the president of the nation\u2019s\u00a0travel and tourism industry warned on Monday night.",
            "\u201cThe latest serious news related to the spread of coronavirus in our country has brought the Italian tourism industry to its knees,\u201d said\u00a0Marina Lalli, the president of\u00a0Italy\u2019s travel and tourism industry Federturismo Confindustria, according to\u00a0a report by Corriere della Sera. Lalli noted that that estimate was made prior to the recent spread of the virus, so it is likely to be on the low end.",
            "\u201cThe most conservative estimates before the release spoke of a loss of 5 billion euros, but now we are in a position that we can no longer even estimate the impact due to the dramatic evolution underway,\u201d she added.",
            "Lalli projects that Italy will suffer a major loss in tourism this year due to international fears over the nation\u2019s recent coronavirus outbreak, which have resulted in 283 confirmed cases and 11 deaths as of Tuesday.",
            "\u201cEven in the case of a rapid solution of the problem for our sector, [tourism] is compromised,\u201d said Lalli, who went on to explain that\u00a0Italy typically receives travel bookings for the entire half of the year by now, but that these booking are \u201cmissing,\u201d along with thousands of existing bookings already canceled.",
            "\u201cIn addition to the thousands of cancellations, there are also the missing bookings for the entire second half of 2020, normally already well underway in this part of the year,\u201d said the president of Federturismo Confindustria.",
            "\u201cIn light of these recent developments and on behalf of a sector that represents over 10 percent of the GDP and over 4 million workers, we wrote to the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte asking for the state of crisis for the tourism sector and to activate all measures of support to protect the jobs and the life of our companies,\u201d added Lalli.",
            "\u201cWe are very worried,\u201d Lalli affirmed. \u201cIn a very short time the situation has advanced.\u201d",
            "\u201cUntil a few days ago, Italy was substantially free from the epidemic, with a very limited number of patients under observation, due to infections contracted abroad,\u201d she added. \u201cToday we are in the eye of the hurricane and the damage to the image has already turned into economic damage.\u201d",
            "Bernab\u00f2 Bocca, the\u00a0president of Federalberghi \u2013 the federation of Italian hotels and tourism \u2013 echoed Lalli\u2019s concerns of the coronavirus\u2019 impact on the Italian economy, stating, \u201cThe stakes are very high.\u201d",
            "\u201cDuring the months of February and March the Italian hospitality establishments hosts 14.5 million Italian and foreign tourists, for almost 40 million overnight stays,\u201d he said.",
            "Bocca added that contrary to what some might believe, February and March are actually high-season months for travel in Italy.",
            "\u201cWe are not in the low season,\u201d said Bocca. \u201cFor some areas of the country, this is a period of intense activity.\u201d",

            "The new form of coronavirus is believed to have originated at a wild meat market in Wuhan, central China, a city of 11 million people, in December.

The Communist Party\u2019s secrecy and reports from health workers in Wuhan of hospitals refusing to test symptomatic patients for coronavirus indicate the available numbers are significantly lower than the true number of cases.",

On Wednesday, the People\u2019s Daily condemned Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross for various comments about China; the attack on Pompeo was particularly confusing because his remark, that China is a top global threat, was about the spread of surveillance technology through Huawei.

            "The novel coronavirus causes fever, difficulty breathing, and other flu-like symptoms. In sensitive patients, it can lead to pneumonia and death.",
            "At least one known patient, however, was a young, healthy adult: Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor detained and humiliated by Communist Party authorities for warning fellow doctors that he believed the virus was contagious. Li did so before authorities had announced the outbreak to the public, thus, according to police, \u201cseverely disturbing public order.\u201d The doctor, 34, died last week, allegedly after contracting the virus.",
            "The record-breaking number of deaths calls into question adamant assurances from Chinese state media in January that the outbreak had already begun to wane and the number of cases begun to fall. The\u00a0Global Times insisted in late January, citing one decline in the number of documented cases over a 24-hour period in which Chinese officials admitted to not having enough testing kits, that a \u201cgleam of hope\u201d had arrived and infections were becoming less common. The\u00a0Global Times\u00a0manipulated the numbers by including cases in Taiwan, a sovereign state with no ties to Beijing, and the autonomous provinces of Hong Kong and Macau, where authorities have done a much more efficient job of containing the outbreak.",
            "China\u2019s response to the outbreak has been largely containment of individuals. Wuhan and its suburbs, also major cities in population size, have gone on total lockdown, limiting travel and canceling public transportation. Reports indicate that suspected patients are being forced into mass quarantine camps in the city. Unverified video and personal testimonies also indicate that police are welding and bolting shut the doors on residential homes, locking people inside suspected of carrying the virus. Multiple reports, including anonymous testimony from doctors, also suggest that hospitals are deliberately failing to test individuals with coronavirus symptoms, artificially deflating the number of confirmed cases.",
            "Chinese authorities again\u00a0attempted to appear in control of the situation on Tuesday, announcing the creation of a new \u201ctask force\u201d in Hubei to organizing virus response. The task force appears to be focusing on evaluating and purging local officials considered insufficiently loyal to Beijing or incompetent. By mid-Tuesday local time, Hubei\u2019s top health officials \u2013 Communist Party health commission boss Zhang Jin and non-Party director Liu Yingzi \u2013 had been fired.",
            "Aiding the Communist Party is a team of WHO experts deployed to China featuring the top officials responsible for the lamentable WHO response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed over 11,000 people. WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Monday that the biggest concern for the agency now is cases transmitted among individuals who had never been in Hubei province \u2013 despite the fact that Beijing confirmed the overwhelming number of cases involved people in or with a past travel history of being in Hubei.",
            "\u201cThe detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire, but for now it\u2019s only a spark,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cOur objective remains containment. We call on all countries to use the window of opportunity we have to prevent a bigger fire.\u201d",
            "Tedros has insisted that he has full confidence in the Chinese Communist Party to contain the outbreak.",
            "\u201cAlthough the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,\u201d he said in January. \u201cFor that, China deserves our gratitude and respect \u2026 China is implementing very serious measures and we cannot ask for more.\u201d",
            "The WHO has excluded Taiwan from international coronavirus response despite its proximity to China at China\u2019s request, resulting in the United Nations agency publishing false information on the number of cases of coronavirus on the island. Taipei has repeatedly condemned its exclusion, noting that it is a developed country with a democracy and advanced healthcare system that could play a major role in saving lives.",

            "The \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d is still the frontrunner, despite former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s win in South Carolina on Saturday. He is widely viewed as the least likely to defeat President Donald Trump in November\u2019s general election.",
            "There are no alternatives to a Sanders-Biden contest, which Biden may struggle to win. The Mike Bloomberg bubble burst at the Nevada debate, and may not recover if Sanders wins California (and Texas) handily on Super Tuesday.",
            "Sanders\u2019s surge is itself the result of a despair that seized many Democrats after the Iowa debate, when it seemed none of the candidates could beat Trump. If they were to lose anyway, better to vote for a sentimental favorite.",
            "So the rise of Sanders is the result of one kind of panic, and the coronavirus panic is another: the reaction of those who believe the \u201cfake news\u201d and have convinced themselves that President Trump really is incompetent in a crisis.",
            "You do not need the majority of people to panic to create a panic. You just need a significant proportion of people, reacting at the same time. And the signal to panic was sent last Tuesday by CDC official\u00a0Dr. Nancy Messonnier.",
            "Dr. Messioner said:\u00a0\u201cWe expect we will see community spread in this country \u2026 It\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d",
            "Her words had an innocuous, scientific meaning: she was predicting there would be some spread of coronavirus (which there has been) and that some people would become seriously ill as a result.",
            "What she did\u00a0not say \u2014 yet what is equally true \u2014 is that \u201ccommunity spread\u201d could be limited, and that we already know that only a small proportion of those who have become infected (and no children!) have become severely ill.",
            "Messonnier is the sister of former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was once suspected of trying to help remove the president from office. But there was no conspiracy at work \u2014 rather, just the ordinary problem of scientists not being very good at communicating to the public, and not realizing that in a climate of uncertainty, enough people will seize on small bits of information and give them the worst interpretation: we\u2019re all gonna die!",
            "The illness is real, and the fear is real, but the reality of coronavirus is not that scary. What gave coronavirus its particular punch is there was already a large group of people in a state of fear, ready \u2014 or even eager \u2014 to panic.",
            "For five years, the media have been telling us that Donald Trump is not just a buffoon and a criminal, but also a danger to national security. (Those words were literally used over and over again in the Senate impeachment trial.) Until late last year, Democrats and journalists hyped every possible speck of bad economic news \u2014 in a tsunami of good data \u2014 to frighten the public into believing a recession was on the way. (Some may even have believed it.)",
            "The economy kept rolling, and Trump kept succeeding. But a good proportion of the general public refused to see it, or could not see it. Democrats, in particular, believed that the country was on the wrong track. Sanders\u2019s rise suggested that they would not be able to remove the cause of their fears at the ballot box, after failing in the Senate, and the coronavirus news made enough of them believe millions of people could suffer \u201csevere illness\u201d as a result.",
            "Trump\u2019s opponents, and those who still live in fear of what he could do, might not, under ordinary circumstances, be able to vote him out. But they still have a \u201cvote\u201d in public sentiment. Their panic is their power. Markets are largely about the public mood, and even \u201cfake news\u201d narratives have impact, if enough people react.",
            "Ironically,\u00a0not being able to vote Trump out of office has partly triggered a panic that has given Trump opponents a chance of doing so.",
            "President Trump has managed coronavirus largely as he should \u2014 better, in fact, because he closed travel to China early, over objections. He has also taken charge of the administration\u2019s message, wisely. But there is little he, or his supporters, can do to stop panic by those determined, or inclined, to do so.",
            "The best response is to keep on keeping on: \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d as FDR said. And, note: at least it didn\u2019t happen in October.",

            "Chinese doctors revealed on January 20 that a new strain of coronavirus, the same grouping of viruses as the one responsible for the deadly 2003 outbreak of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), had begun spreading in Wuhan, likely from the consumption of wild animal meat. The revelation occurred nearly a month after authorities shut down the wild game and seafood market believed responsible for selling the meat in question, leading many to wonder what took so long to warn local health officials and civilians.",
            "By Tuesday, authorities had identified\u00a04,682 cases of novel coronavirus worldwide, the overwhelming majority of them in China. Of those infected, 106 people have died, all in China. Europe, North America, and Australia have all identified cases, but none in critical condition.",
            "Viral infection is typically accompanied by flu-like symptoms: fever, difficulty breathing, and coughing, among others. These symptoms, particularly in sensitive patients, cause pneumonia, which can lead to death. Chinese doctors have warned, however, there is a possibility that asymptomatic carriers are also contagious.",
            "The\u00a0Epoch Times, a U.S.-based newspaper that often focuses on human rights abuses committed by the Communist Party of China, cited interviews on Monday with an unnamed \u201cinsider\u201d and an \u201cindependent journalist\u201d within Wuhan, both of whom said that Chinese doctors were not testing people who requested it showing symptoms of infection. The party is significantly limiting access to testing kits, which makes it more difficult to confirm cases of novel coronavirus \u2014 thus suppressing the official number of known cases of the disease.",
            "\u201cMedical personnel at these hospitals [in Wuhan] have said that the number of kits they are supplied is less than 10 percent of what they need to test patients,\u201d the\u00a0Epoch Times noted. \u201cNow these hospitals claim that their responsibility at present is to provide treatment only, and they will not perform any diagnoses. Patients who are seeking a diagnosis are unable to get one and find themselves in a desperate situation.\u201d",
            "The alleged \u201cinsider\u201d told the newspaper that Chinese public health officials initially significantly limited testing for the virus to maintain the appearance that the outbreak was in control. When cases of the virus began surfacing internationally, Beijing was cornered into offering more realistic numbers of infection, creating an artificial surge in the number of cases.",
            "\u201cInitially, there were several days in a row when there was not a single confirmed patient with\u00a0Wuhan pneumonia. But when other countries identified patients among people [traveling] from China, the CDC was forced to increase its reported cases,\u201d the \u201cinsider\u201d is quoted as saying. \u201cThat explains why all of a sudden China reported more than one hundred newly confirmed cases in a couple [of] days. They are manipulating the tally. The real number of patients is far greater.\u201d",
            "Now that China feels compelled to test for cases, the \u201cinsider\u201d claimed that officials are cherry-picking individuals hoping to choose the ones likeliest to recover. They are actively choosing not to test health workers, as a higher number of infected workers would indicate that Wuhan did not do enough to protect them.",
            "The\u00a0Epoch Times report corroborates evidence surfacing since China first admitted the virus was spreading from other reports citing locals in the city who said hospitals turned them away. Perhaps the most high-profile such case is that of the family of Chinese environmentalist Xu Dapeng. Xu, founder of the Friends of Nature NGO \u2014 the largest environmental group in the country \u2014 was pronounced dead three days after China announced the discovery of the new virus. Xu\u2019s official cause of death is \u201cpneumonia\u201d \u2014 the same as his wife, who died ten days before him. According to Radio Free Asia (RFA), Wuhan doctors refused to test him or his wife for coronavirus, then refused to test their still-living daughter, who had ample exposure to her dying parents. They have also refused to isolate Xu\u2019s daughter or anyone in contact with the dead couple, allowing for potential further contamination.",
            "RFA inquired with the local Center for Disease Control (CDC), which confirmed that only state-approved individuals can receive testing for coronavirus.",
            "\u201cAn official who answered the phone at the Wuhan CDC confirmed that health authorities aren\u2019t taking reports of infections or deaths or isolation inquiries from members of the public, only from hospitals,\u201d RFA noted. \u201cIf hospitals don\u2019t report a case as being suspected nCoV, then the relatives of the infected patients are left to their own devices, the official said.\u201d",
            "Similarly, a phone call by the\u00a0Epoch Times to a Wuhan hospital yielded confirmation that \u201cthe hospital now only accepts patients who were selected and approved by the Wuhan Health Commission.\u201d",
            "Another Wuhan resident, Zhang Changchun, told the Reuters news agency that he and his brother have tried to receive medical care for their mother, who exhibits clear signs of a respiratory infection, but doctors turn them away.",
            "\u201cMy brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don\u2019t get any new answers,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cEvery time the responses are the same: \u2018There\u2019s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what\u2019s going on.\u2019 The doctors are all very frustrated too.\u201d",
            "Zhang\u2019s mother has not been tested for coronavirus, even though a doctor reportedly told her that she \u201calmost certainly\u201d has it, Reuters noted.",
            "Chinese state propaganda outlet\u00a0Global Times\u00a0admitted last week that Wuhan has failed to conduct adequate testing of suspected patients, but claimed the issue was a shortage of testing kits, not a concerted effort to suppress the true outbreak numbers.",
            "\u201cShortage of medical resources, especially the testing kits, keep hovering [sic] hospitals in Wuhan, capital of central Central China\u2019s Hubei Province, while the whole China is fighting together against the novel coronavirus originatinged [sic] in the city,\u201d the\u00a0Global Times\u00a0claimed. Noting a \u201csevere shortage\u201d of testing kits, the\u00a0Times also confirmed that hospitals are not allowed to test for the virus without Party approval.",
            "\u201cThe reagent [testing] kits were first sent over to local centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) in each place. For now, at least, the CDC remains [sic] the primary users of the agency controlling kits use, whereas the main task of the hospitals is are to diagnose and treat suspected and confirmed patients,\u201d the\u00a0Times confirmed.",
            "Due to the poor handling of the situation, University of Hong Kong medical researchers warned on Monday that the true number of people infected could be closer to 44,000 in Wuhan alone than 5,000. Gabriel Leung, the dean of the university\u2019s medical school, told reporters that the virus could continue spreading into the summer and that world governments must consider \u201cdraconian measures\u201d to contain it, particularly in China.",
            "Despite the ample evidence that the Communist Party failed to react quickly enough to contain the virus, World Health Organization (WHO) Secretary-General\u00a0Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the Party during a visit to Beijing on Tuesday for its \u201cdecisive measures\u201d and recommended against foreign states evacuating its citizens from China.",
            "\u201cAfter the outbreak of pneumonia, China identified the pathogens in record time, shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the WHO and other countries, and carried out a series of effective measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus,\u201d Ghebreyesus said, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.",
            "\u201cTedros said the WHO and the international community speak highly of and fully affirm the decisive measures the Chinese government has taken, and appreciate China\u2019s great efforts in curbing the spread of pneumonia,\u201d Xinhua added.",
            "The WHO, at China\u2019s behest, has for many years banned Taiwan from participating in any global public health efforts despite its wealth and advanced technology. Taiwan has documented seven cases of coronavirus at press time and made a request to the WHO, a United Nations body, to be allowed to partake in the response.",

That was a big decision. That was the decision President [Barack] Obama was not willing to make about the Ebola crisis in 2014. But he s engaged, and he is directing a very aggressive effort to prevent any further outbreaks than what we have in the country right now. Because ultimately, the most important thing is the health, safety, and security of the american people. There may, indeed, be some economic effects \u2014 we can\u2019t deny that \u2014 we don\u2019t know how severe it will be. But if there [are] any economic effects, China will be 100% to blame for those effects because they have been so dishonest and corrupt and deceitful from the very beginning, when this virsus started breaking out in late November and early December. I am confident that the American worker, the American farmer, the American rancher can fight through it: even if there is something of an economic slowdown due to coronavirus, it won\u2019t be nearly as bad here as it is in China.

Doctors within Wuhan\u2019s hospitals have said they cannot access testing kits for every patient showing the symptoms of carrying the virus, mostly respiratory symptoms. Patients say they have gone to the hospitals with fever, coughing, and other telltale signs of infection and been told that only patients government health officials approve of can receive testing to confirm their status.

            "North Korea canceled two major annual festivals in Pyongyang celebrating the birthday of late communist dictator Kim Jong-il due to fears of a potential spread of coronavirus, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported Friday.",
            "North Korean authorities have already been forced to take a series of preventative measures against the potential spread of the coronavirus, which broke out in neighboring China. The North Korean regime has so far refused to confirm any cases of the virus within the country, although South Korean media has reported that several people have already died.",
            "North Korea\u2019s habitual lack\u00a0of honesty has made gauging its concern\u00a0difficult, but sources in Pyongyang who spoke to RFA\u2019s Korean Service claimed that the\u00a0Mt.\u00a0Paektu\u00a0Prize Sports Festival and the February Spring Arts Festival, both of which are held on Kim\u2019s birthday (February 16), were canceled as preventative measures.",
            "\u201cThe Mt.\u00a0Paektu\u00a0Prize Sports Festival and the February Spring Arts Festival, which are huge national events were canceled due to the recent coronavirus outbreak,\u201d a resident\u00a0of\u00a0Pyongyang told RFA\u2019s Korean Service this week. \u201c[The festival] began in 1977 and has continued every year until this year.\u00a0It\u2019s the first time in 43 years that it has been canceled.\u201d",
            "The father of current dictator Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il\u2019s birthday became a national holiday during his rule over the country. Following his death in 2011, it became known as the \u201cDay of the Shining Star.\u201d The birthday of his father and the founder of communist North Korea, Kim Il-sung, remains known as the \u201cDay of the Sun.\u201d",
            "",
            "According to the source, canceling the Mt. Paektu Prize Sports Festival is akin to canceling the Super Bowl in the United States, with the events drawing mass attention nationwide.",
            "\u201cAs the new coronavirus situation became more serious, the preliminary games for the\u00a0festival\u00a0were held without spectators.\u00a0But now the athletes who earned the right to compete in Pyongyang are frustrated that the Central Committee [of the Korean Workers\u2019 Party] canceled the entire event,\u201d the source said.",
            "A separate source explained that the February Spring Arts Festival has also taken place every year since 1974, with Kim Jong-un having planned to attend this year\u2019s event.",
            "\u201cEvery year the final round of the arts festival is held in Pyongyang, showcasing the talents of the best artists from each province,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great spectacle for everyone\u2026 Artists who were selected for the finals after\u00a0besting the\u00a0fierce competition in\u00a0their home region\u00a0are very disappointed with the sudden cancellation.\u201d",
            "The fact that neither festival was reported within North Korean state media indicates that they did not take place, while the coronavirus appears to be the only logical explanation for their cancelation.",
            "As recently noted by the World Health Organization (WHO) chief\u00a0Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, there is\u00a0concern among experts over a possible epidemic in a poverty-stricken country such as North Korea, as their healthcare systems are woefully unequipped to handle its impact.",
            "\u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it,\u201d\u00a0 Tedros said this month.",

            "Another factor appears to be the regime\u2019s growing antipathy to homosexuality, as some of the recently banned websites included gay themes that have been ruled \u201clewd\u201d or \u201cindecent.\u201d Chinese bloggers who post gay material appear to have gotten the message, cutting back on posts for at least the first few days of the new regulations until they see how aggressive enforcement will be.",
            "The New York Times speculated last week that the coronavirus has done real damage to China\u2019s censorship machine, a perspective from which the new set of tighter regulations and more explicit penalties could be seen as an effort to claw back power and status.\u00a0",
            "The Chinese Internet has been buzzing with criticism of the government response to the epidemic, with the oppressed public growing increasingly bold as they see more of their fellow citizens speaking out and getting away with it.\u00a0",
            "Chinese social media users have been especially vicious in tearing apart Beijing\u2019s propaganda campaigns, and they refuse to forget that early whistleblowers were treated like criminals for daring to raise alarms about the virus threat. The Times described a few of the more spectacular propaganda failures:",
            "One newspaper in the city of Xi\u2019an apologized after it posted an article claiming that a nurse\u2019s newborn twins asked their father where their mother was, saying it was an editing mistake. Another newspaper wrote that after a nurse went to the front line, her husband, who had been in a vegetative state since 2014, would smile whenever her name was mentioned \u201cas if he knew that his wife was engaged in a great endeavor.\u201d That story was later deleted.",
            "In China, admiration of the front-line medical workers is widespread and sincere. But the state media\u2019s coverage does not show the reality that many of those workers lack protective gear. Over 3,000 of them have been infected.",
            "\u201cTheir sacrifices should be remembered,\u201d wrote a user on Weibo, one of China\u2019s most popular social media sites. \u201cWe should make sure that the tragedies won\u2019t happen again, not highlighting \u2018Sacrifice is glorious.\u2019\u201d",
            "One of the highest-profile public relations busts was the Communist Party\u2019s wave of planted \u201cnews\u201d stories about female nurses shaving their heads so their protective gear would fit better, and they wouldn\u2019t be distracted from their medical duties by grooming themselves. The Communist Party thought the public would be impressed by the selfless dedication of the nurses but, instead, they were horrified by the spectacle of young women being forced to shave their heads for propaganda videos.",
            "Another brainstorm from Party headquarters involved creating a pair of cartoon youth mascots for the anti-coronavirus effort with names drawn from the poetry of Chinese Communism founding father Mao Zedong. This campaign flopped so hard that it was withdrawn after about five hours of intense public sarcasm from China\u2019s young people.",
            "The coronavirus epidemic also physically damaged China\u2019s labor-intensive censorship system by infecting some of the people who work for the Cyberspace Administration, a development that was greeted with quite a bit of rejoicing from Chinese dissidents.",
            "Some of those dissidents predicted the Communist Party bit off more than it can chew by imposing the new regulations, since the amount of content created by citizens is growing faster than even the most heavily-staffed regulatory agencies can keep pace with, and the coronavirus crisis is teaching a growing number of Chinese citizens how to bypass the infamous \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d to get news from the outside world and disseminate forbidden opinions.",
            "\u201cSuch meaningless rules. In addition to providing the government more excuses, it\u2019s not even clear how this should work,\u201d one critic posted on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, which has long been banned by the authoritarian Communist regime. "

            "Chinese state media revealed Sunday that four local Communist Party officials in Wuhan had been \u201cpunished\u201d after a suspected coronavirus patient hanged himself.",
            "Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is the epicenter of the current novel coronavirus outbreak, believed to have been triggered by locals selling and eating wild game meat at an open market. The Chinese communist regime shut the market down nearly a month before alerting the general public to the presence of a contagious disease, allowing millions to leave Wuhan for the Lunar New Year holiday and hospitals to treat coronavirus patients in the same quarters as other sensitive patients.",
            "The result of the Communist Party\u2019s failures has been an outbreak affecting over 70,000 people worldwide and killing over 1,000, most of them in China.",
            "Reports have surfaced of hospitals in Wuhan turning potential coronavirus patients away, significantly limiting local health officials\u2019 ability to track the disease but artificially deflating the number of confirmed cases in the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s tally. Suppressing the real numbers can help give the impression that the outbreak is more contained and less of an emergency than it is.",
            "Locals in Wuhan have revealed through anonymous reports that, for weeks, hospitals told walk-in patients that they only had permission to test \u201cauthorized\u201d patients for coronavirus \u2013 that is, patients with special hospital approval, not merely patients with fever, difficulty breathing, or other visible symptoms. Those turned away were, in many cases, quarantined at home. Videos surfacing online showed\u00a0Communist Party authorities bolting and welding shut the doors of families believed to have been exposed to the virus.",
            "One of those cases of patients turned away, the state-run\u00a0Global Times revealed on Monday, resulted in a suicide.\u00a0The propaganda outlet identified the man only as \u201cCheng\u201d and said that officials received information that the man had exhibited signs of carrying the virus, but did not offer him any medical attention.",
            "\u201cCheng eventually hanged himself to death,\u201d the\u00a0Global Times noted.",
            "The case shares similarities with a suicide in India last week. Bala Krishna, a 50-year-old farmer, fell ill and ultimately hanged himself. Unlike Cheng, however, Krishna received medical treatment and was confirmed to not be a coronavirus carrier, instead suffering from another type of viral infection that doctors insisted did not pose a threat to his neighborhood or family. Krishna insisted that he had coronavirus, threw stones at relatives who tried to get close to him, and ultimately hanged himself.",
            "Four local officials in Wuhan \u201chave been punished for failing to report a patient suspected to be infected with the virus in time, which resulted in the patient\u2019s death,\u201d the newspaper said. It later specified that the \u201cpunishment\u201d was a \u201cwarning from the Party for knowing about Cheng\u2019s illness but failing to take the necessary measures in time\u201d for two of the officials. The other two \u201cwere criticized,\u201d it added.",
            "The Chinese government has moved first against officials whose behavior prompted deaths outside of those diagnosed with coronavirus. The first firing of multiple officials in Hubei, for example, resulted from officials quarantining an entire family except for a 16-year-old with cerebral palsy, who died as he was left alone for six days and needed round-the-clock care to survive.",
            "\u201cI have two disabled sons. My older son Yan Cheng has cerebral palsy. He cannot move his body, he cannot speak or look after himself. He has already been at home by himself for six days, with nobody to bathe him or change his clothes and nothing to eat or drink,\u201d the teen\u2019s father wrote in a social media post the government later censored.",
            "China Daily, another government propaganda newspaper, reported\u00a0on Sunday that others in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, had \u201cbeen removed from office or disciplined\u201d for similar failures in addressing the outbreak. Their cases received public repudiation through an announcement by the province\u2019s Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Commission, the Communist Party bureaucracy\u2019s punitive agencies. While the article identified several individuals already known to have publicly lost their jobs, it revealed other cases of Communist Party officials fabricating data on the viral outbreak, \u201cacting irresponsibly,\u201d and working \u201cby phone\u201d:",
            "Wang Gonghua, deputy director of the standing committee of the Danjiangkou people\u2019s congress, made up work logs. Wang Xujie, chairman of the Yunxi county committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, loosely implemented quarantine rules, as did Zheng Zhongtan, deputy director of Yunxi county\u2019s legislature, who carried out the work by phone.",
            "Two other typical cases featured local Party committees acting irresponsibly by allowing banquets and public gatherings. You Hao and Liu Yu, Party chiefs of Chunmuying and Maobei townships in Enshi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture, were both removed from their posts.",
            "Allowing public events is believed to be one of the ways in which the number of coronavirus cases grew into the tens of thousands. The weekend before China alerted the world to the existence of a previously unidentified type of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, the city attempted to break the world record for largest banquet with an annual Lunar New Year feast. The event attracted about 130,000 people and was primarily targeted at older \u201cempty nest\u201d residents whose children could not be home for the holiday. Elderly coronavirus patients are believed to make up most of the global death toll.",
            "Beijing-based Communist Party propaganda has also disparaged Wuhan officials for causing unnecessary trauma to coronavirus patients. Last week, the\u00a0Global Times\u00a0revealed a harrowing incident in which local officials attempted to transfer elderly coronavirus patients to a new hospital. They did not use a specialized hospital vehicle; a public bus driver was expected to drive a large number of elderly patients \u2013 for which the bus did not have enough seats \u2013 to the hospital without directions. Neither the driver nor the patients received any protective care and the driver got lost for hours. The\u00a0Global Times documented \u201cseveral emotional breakdowns\u201d on the driver\u2019s part alone.",
            "Just as it has shifted all blame for the coronavirus outbreak on local officials, Beijing government media has given all praise for any positive responses to the outbreak to dictator Xi Jinping and senior Communist Party officials. Xi punished the text of a recent speech as an opinion column in state media Monday, declaring himself the leader of the outbreak response and urging full obedience to Beijing from the people, a response to growing discontent against his leadership in the country. Xinhua, the government news service, also published a story claiming the international community is praising Xi personally for his handling of the outbreak.",
            "At press time, global health authorities have identified 71,812 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide and 1,775 deaths, nearly all of them in China. Cases have been confirmed in Europe, Africa, and North America as well as other countries of Asia.",

            "Wuhan is the center of the coronavirus outbreak, while Xinjiang features dozens of overcrowded, unsanitary concentration camps that could allow the virus to spread rapidly among the Uyghurs.",
            "According to Radio Free Asia (RFA), the 99 people under quarantine might just be the tip of the iceberg, because up to 13,000 people from the heavily-populated Wuhan area might have reached the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) before quarantine was imposed.",
            "Even the story about the 99 people isolated at a hotel in Atush was not easy to get, because Chinese officials are treating information about the virus as a classified \u201cstate secret\u201d:",
            "RFA was able to speak with several officials in Atush, in the XUAR\u2019s Kizilsu Kirghiz (Kezileisu Keerkezi) Autonomous Prefecture, who said on condition of anonymity that at least 99 residents of Wuhan had been quarantined at the city\u2019s Yashin Hotel, with additional people from the virus\u2019s epicenter possibly held under similar conditions in another guesthouse.",
            "\u201cOur cadres said [the Wuhan residents] are being quarantined in hotels such as the Yashin and the Mirivan, where they have rooms for people to stay,\u201d an official with the municipal government said on Tuesday, without providing details of when the quarantine had gone into effect.",

            "RFA spoke with a security guard at the Yashin Hotel who confirmed the quarantine, but said he was unsure of how many people were being held there.",

A little less than half of those deaths, about 300, allegedly occurred in Qom, the city to first confirm a case of novel coronavirus, PMOI/MEK officials stated.",
            "According to the organization\u2019s statement, as of Sunday night, the group had compiled evidence of \u201csome\u00a0150 victims in Tehran, 46 in Isfahan, 23 in Gilan, 18 in Lorestan and 45 in Kermanshah provinces,\u201d but named several other smaller cities whose health workers had reported deaths attributable to the virus.",

            "The IRGC is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an official wing of the Iranian military, but a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.\nThe organization noted that Iran had yet to block flights from China, the country where the virus originated and accused Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of ordering a cover-up to boost turnout for the February 23 sham parliamentary elections. The attempt failed; the elections boasted the lowest turnout in Iran\u2019s history since the 1979 revolution, yielding a \u201cvictory\u201d for the \u201chard-line\u201d Islamist wing of the government.",

Internationally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has documented 89,198 cases of the virus and a little over 3,000 deaths. In Iran, the government officially claims over 1,510 confirmed cases and\u00a066 deaths. Iranian media claimed that another over 4,000 individuals are \u201csuspected\u201d of carrying the novel coronavirus.",
            "International reports, evidence from groups like PMOI/MEK, and statements from officials within the Iranian government have all challenged Tehran\u2019s official case tallies since the Iranian government revealed the virus had migrated there from China last month. Last week, the BBC published a report stating that it had independently confirmed 210 deaths in the country, a far larger number than the 34 on the official government register. In response to that report,\u00a0Iranian Member of Parliament Gholamali Jafarzadeh Imenabadi publicly stated that official statements were \u201cnot true,\u201d citing the surge of individuals being buried at cemeteries in affected communities.",
            "\u201cI have statistics about the number of deaths due to coronavirus from three different cemeteries in Rasht and I have to say that the numbers are much higher than what is being said,\u201d Imenabadi said.",
            "A week before Imenabadi made his remarks, another lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farhani, openly denounced the regime for lying, stating that 50 people had died from the Chinese coronavirus at a time in which Iran had only revealed 12 deaths.",
            "Public health experts also doubt the Iranian government case numbers accurately reflect the situation on the ground. Asif Shuja of the National University of Singapore\u2019s Middle East Institute told CNBC in a report published Monday that the fact that Iran announced its first cases of coronavirus simultaneous to its announcement of the first deaths indicates that they knew of the individuals dying as confirmed cases before they died and hid the cases until their deaths.",
            "\u201cThat is what can compel anyone that there has been cover-up, as far as infection is concerned,\u201d Shuja said, adding that the timing of the outbreak alongside parliamentary elections also created \u201ca lot of compulsion to restrict the information related to that because they still had two days for the election \u2026 That is why one can safely assume that the information that is coming out of Iran is not entirely to be trusted.\u201d",
            "There is compelling evidence to believe the outbreak has expanded out of Qom and into the highest levels of the Iranian Islamic regime. On Monday, several Iranian news outlets confirmed the death of\u00a0Seyed Mohammad Mir-Mohammadi, 71, a member of\u00a0Iran\u2019s Expediency Discernment Council and thus one of Khamenei\u2019s top advisers.

            "North Korea still officially claims it has zero cases of coronavirus infection, but one of its officials told Radio Free Asia (RFA) on Saturday that 1,300 people suspected of carrying the virus have been quarantined at a hotel in Pyongyang.\u00a0",
            "The facility, named the \u201c4.25 Hotel\u201d in honor of the April 25, 1932, founding of the Korean People\u2019s Revolutionary Army, has a maximum capacity of about 20,000 guests. It was not clear from the official\u2019s comments if the entire hotel has been repurposed as a quarantine facility or only one of its wings. The source said close to 2,000 patients were originally isolated in the hotel but about 500 of them have been \u201cdischarged because their symptoms have eased.\u201d",
            "RFA cited disturbing reports from its sources that the North Korean leadership has essentially thrown most of their population to the wolves and is focused on keeping the coronavirus away from the leadership in Pyongyang.\u00a0",
            "\u201cThe authorities declared the new coronavirus quarantine as a matter of national survival, so they are focusing their efforts on protecting Pyongyang, where the supreme leadership of the government is located,\u201d as RFA\u2019s source put it.",
            "In the North Korean capital, people who cough and run a fever are whisked away to the quarantine hotel. A hotline has been established for Pyongyang residents to report suspected infections. An emergency quarantine committee is preparing reports twice a day on the number of infected.",
            "Out in the provinces, RFA reported a hospital quietly cremating suspected coronavirus fatalities. Shortages of protective gear and medicine are likely as supplies are shifted to Pyongyang, which nevertheless remains \u201cill-equipped for a potential epidemic\u201d and already appears to be suffering from a shortage of protective masks.",
            "The BBC reported on Monday that about 380 foreigners have been quarantined in Pyongyang, most of them diplomatic personnel confined to their compounds. An earlier quarantine period was supposed to expire last weekend, but it was extended and broadened to include almost twice as many people. New foreign visitors have been ordered to undergo quarantine for 30 days.",
            "The BBC quoted a North Korean state media report that said about 3,000 people are being monitored for possible coronavirus symptoms in North Pyongan, a province bordering China.",
            "NPR noted that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has been disappearing from the public eye for much longer periods of time than usual since the coronavirus epidemic began, and some public events have been canceled, moves which are difficult to square with Pyongyang\u2019s insistence for the record that \u201cnot one novel coronavirus patient has emerged.\u201d",
            "A doctor working in South Korea who has visited numerous North Korean hospitals over the years told NPR that his contacts in North Korea are reaching out through back channels to plead for shipments of protective gear.\u00a0",
            "Other health experts argued that North Korea\u2019s perpetual struggles to deal with tuberculosis and hepatitis do not bode well for its ability to resist the coronavirus, and historically every Chinese disease outbreak spreads into North Korea eventually. They also noted that reporting coronavirus infections while the dictatorship claims there aren\u2019t any would be much more hazardous to one\u2019s health than the virus itself, so news about outbreaks will probably move much more slowly than anywhere else in the world, even repressive China.",
            "Foreign Policy noted that North Korea could not possibly afford to keep its border with China closed for long, and smugglers are most likely violating the travel restrictions currently in place. As FP recalled, China\u2019s swine flu epidemic \u2013 the big Chinese plague story before the coronavirus was unleashed \u2013 rapidly spread into North Korea and wiped out every single hog in North Pyongan province, the very same area where 3,000 people are now under observation for Wuhan virus infection according to the BBC."

A dismaying number of Chinese travelers have been arriving at airports around the world with Wuhan infections that are caught during airport screening for the infection.\u00a0",
            "The patient described by the SCMP is a railroad worker who lives in Tianjin, a huge city close to Beijing. A total of 28 coronavirus cases have now been detected in Tianjin. The man was reportedly quarantined in his home after he first checked into a local hospital with a fever on January 19, even though the first tests for the Wuhan virus came back negative, thus minimizing his contact with other people.",
            "As of Monday morning, the coronavirus has been detected in 17,491 patients and is believed responsible for 362 deaths. The SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, to which the Wuhan virus is frequently compared, infected 5,327 people in mainland China and killed 349 of them. As these numbers suggest, the Wuhan virus is much more infectious than SARS but also much less likely to kill its victims.",
            "The Wuhan virus is particularly insidious because infected people can be contagious for up to two weeks without displaying any outward symptoms. The SCMP recounted the case of a German businessman who got sick on a flight back from China, seemingly recovered after a few days, but then tested positive for the Wuhan virus after one of the people he met with in China grew ill and tested positive.",
            "Wired reported on Saturday that epidemiologists are worried about \u201csuper-spreaders,\u201d people who carry the Wuhan virus and can infect others while going for exceptionally long periods without experiencing any sign of illness. Super-spreading is difficult to monitor because the spreaders do not feel sick, so they might not seek medical treatment, making it difficult to trace chains of infection back to them. A larger number of people who carry the virus without any symptoms of illness could be one reason why the Wuhan virus is spreading so much more rapidly than SARS.",
            "Politics could be another reason. Al-Jazeera noted on Monday that people in Wuhan are furious at the Chinese government for downplaying the severity of the viral outbreak and giving false assurances that the situation was under control.\u00a0",
            "As recently as last week, incredulous residents of Wuhan reported seeing propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party that hailed the government for a \u201ctransparent and swift\u201d response that \u201chighly impressed\u201d international observers and supposedly contained the epidemic. Angry people in the outbreak area used social media to complain about slow medical responses, overwhelmed hospitals, and a media blackout that lasted until just a few days before the entire province was placed on lockdown."

Connecticut is one of the 33 states with confirmed cases of coronavirus. Senator, it\u2019s good to have you here this morning. And I\u2019m sorry to hear about what\u2019s happening in my home state of Connecticut. How many cases do you think there are right now? There are two that have been reported.",

And the fact of the matter is we can\u2019t make good judgments about the measures we should be taking in Seattle or in Danbury or Hartford unless we are able to do these tests. And what is unforgivable is that the administration didn\u2019t see this coming and didn\u2019t put the resources in early to make sure that everybody had these tests available. But we are likely going to have to take much stronger measures as time goes on. But nobody understands where the epidemic is the worst until we get tests widely deployed.",

            "MURPHY: We are not seeing that in Connecticut. We now have private lab capacity to do tests. But our understanding is that we are nowhere near that number that was proffered by the administration last year of a million. We are doing a lot more screening in our state, but we do not have the ability to give a test to everyone who wants one, as the president said was the case on Friday afternoon. And that is incredibly concerning given the fact that we saw this epidemic coming. We could have made a decision back in January or February to accept the WHO test that was available to us or start putting serious resources into developing our own test. The administration did neither and they did neither,\u00a0because this president has created a culture of misinformation in which no one wants to give him bad news.

            "Khamenei added that the Islamic regime has addressed it with \u201csincerity\u201d despite widespread complaints from even those within the government that the regime is lying about the number of cases.",
            "Iran claims it has confirmed 2,336 cases of Wuhan coronavirus in the country and, among those, 77 people have died. These numbers differ significantly from what reports on the ground from dissident groups suggest. The People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI /MEK), a dissident organization that relies on sources inside the country for its reports, claimed on Monday it had evidence of as many as 1,000 deaths due to the Chinese coronavirus nationwide. Multiple Iranian lawmakers have also alleged they have reason to believe the official government tallies are artificially suppressing the true number of cases.",
            "\u201cI feel it is my duty to once again thank these dear ones who are doing Jihad for the sake of God with their invaluable efforts,\u201d Khamenei said in his remarks, which occurred during a tree-planting ceremony for Iran\u2019s \u201cWeek of Natural Resources.\u201d \u201cI ask God to bring health to the sick, to grant His mercy on the deceased, and\u00a0to bestow patience and\u00a0tranquillity on their survivors.\u201d",
            "Khamenei said that any action that helps the virus spread \u201cis a sin\u201d and that all Iranian citizens must obey the Ministry of Health or face significant consequences. He attempted to portray the virus as a mild threat to the country not comparable to others the regime has faced in the past.",
            "\u201cThe Coronavirus is not such a big tragedy and\u00a0this country has surmounted graver ones. However, beseeching God, seeking intercession from the Prophet and\u00a0his Household, and\u00a0the prayers of the pure youth and pious are very effective in repelling major tragedies,\u201d Khamenei claimed.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s unimportant, but let\u2019s not exaggerate it either. The Coronavirus will affect the country briefly & leave. But the experience it brings, and\u00a0the actions of the people & the govt sectors, are like a public exercise that will remain as an achievement.\u201d",

Tasnim News, an Iranian propaganda outlet, appeared to differ somewhat from Khamenei\u2019s official website, transcribing his description of a \u201cpublic exercise\u201d as a \u201cwar game,\u201d much more bellicose language than Khamenei\u2019s website translation.",

Saudi Arabia and Iran are regional rivals and Iran has continuously challenged Riyadh\u2019s control of the holiest cities in Islam, Mecca and Medina.",
            "Khamenei\u2019s insistence that Iran has offered \u201ctransparency\u201d contradicts several remarks not just from opposition groups and dissidents, but from members of the Iranian government who have questioned the response to the outbreak. The first cases of coronavirus identified in Iran occurred in the city of Qom, which has high religious significance for Shiite Muslims and thus attracts many tourists. At press time, Iran has not yet offered an explanation for how the virus got there, as it originated in Wuhan, central China.",
            "While Iranian health authorities claim slightly more than 2,000 cases nationwide, local officials have dismissed that number, stating it is impossibly low given how high the numbers are at the local level. One Iranian lawmaker,\u00a0Gholam Ali Jafarzadeh Imanabadi, called the official tally \u201csomething like a joke,\u201d asserting he had evidence that his native Gilan Province had hundreds of more cases than those counted.\u00a0Mohammad Hossein Qorbani, a colleague of Imanabadi\u2019s from the same province, has also accused the government of being too slow in offering test results, as all testing kits reportedly have to travel to Tehran and back to yield confirmation of coronavirus.",
            "Iran is using homemade testing kits of questionable quality, according to President Hassan Rouhani, who proudly announced Iran was the only country making indigenous testing kits rather than asking for help from the World Health Organization (WHO).",

Also among the highest levels of the Iranian government, one of Iran\u2019s several vice presidents and the head of coronavirus response have both tested positive for the virus. A senior adviser to Khamenei became the first casualty of the coronavirus in the government this week.",
            "The Chinese coronavirus typically causes flu-like symptoms including difficulty breathing, coughing, body aches, and fevers. Some patients do not exhibit any symptoms at all, while others have more severe symptoms that evolve into pneumonia and death. The virus appears to more severely affect people over 60 and those with pre-existing health problems, though deaths have been recorded among those of all ages and conditions.",

            "The \u201cayurveda\u201d referenced in AYUSH\u2019s name is a form of Hindu holistic medicine. \u201cUnani\u201d is an ancient Greek system of alternative medicine, including herbal treatments and special diets, that is now practiced primarily in India. \u201cSiddha\u201d is a very old Indian mystical discipline viewed with particular skepticism by the country\u2019s medical community. \u201cSowa rigpa\u201d is a Tibetan school of holistic medicine.\u00a0",
            "AYUSH is an Indian government ministry that has existed under various names since 1995, evolving into its current title and mission scope in 2014. Its goal was to recognize the popularity of alternative medicine in India, bring some academic rigor to the most popular disciplines, and reconcile their beliefs with modern medicine. The Indian medical community tends to view AYUSH as a regrettable effort to legitimize quackery, especially when increased government funding is devoted to the homeopathic ministry.",
            "On Wednesday, AYUSH published an \u201cadvisory\u201d for the coronavirus describing homeopathic remedies \u201cuseful in symptomatic management\u201d of the epidemic. India\u2019s first confirmed case of the Wuhan virus was reported the following day, a student in the southern state of Kerala who had recently returned from Wuhan University in China.",
            "Some of the recommendations in the AYUSH advisory were common bits of advice for reducing contamination risk that would be given by any doctor, such as recommendations to clean and disinfect frequently, wear a mask in public places, and \u201cavoid close contact with people who are sick.\u201d",
            "The \u201cprophylactic\u201d measures based on ayurveda and unani prescribed by AYUSH attracted stern criticism for the IMA, since they included herbal mixtures and homeopathic practices that have not been clinically tested.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe specifically think the AYUSH ministry going to town with such recommendations for an outbreak of such global nature is immature, premature and irresponsible \u2013 particularly at a time when it\u2019s a public health emergency and the first case is already reported in Kerala and India is ripped open,\u201d said IMA Secretary-General Dr. RV Asokan.",
            "Dr. Asokan sarcastically wondered why \u201csystems of medicines which do not even recognize microbes as disease-causing agents\u201d would claim they can treat infections.",
            "A heated argument erupted on social media between alternative medicine supporters and critics. Some critics who are normally indulgent of homeopathy expressed alarm that a government ministry would promote it as effective against the highly contagious Wuhan virus. Among the dangers is that the disciplines promoted by AYUSH tend to be viewed by adherents as ancient secrets whose power baffles modern science, so people following the advice given in the advisory bulletin might believe they have gained some supernatural degree of resistance to the coronavirus.",
            "The defense offered by an alternative-medicine advocate to the South China Morning Post would probably do little to alleviate the IMA\u2019s concerns. The Post\u00a0reported:",

            "Asked about the possible side-effects of the recommended treatment for the coronavirus \u2013 a highly diluted solution of arsenic trioxide used by homoeopaths that has in the past resulted in arsenic poisoning due to negligence \u2013 Joshi said the suggested quantity would not have serious consequences.",

            "The ban represents a major strengthening of wildlife laws dating back to the late 1980s. Outside observers believe many of those laws have been ignored until now, including those mandating food safety checks.\u00a0",
            "In the words of the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, \u201cthe eating of wild animals and the huge hidden threat to public health from the practice have attracted wide attention.\u201d The ban went into effect immediately on Monday.",
            "According to the Standing Committee, the ban will include hunting, trading, and transporting wild animals, including those from breeding farms, but not \u201caquatic animals, livestock, poultry, and other animals that have a long been bred in the country.\u201d The use of animals in medical research and Chinese traditional medicine will continue, but with stronger oversight.",
            "Although national Communist Party officials and political analysts strove to minimize the economic fallout from shutting down the wildlife industry, the SCMP noted that some of China\u2019s poorest regions are heavily dependent upon wildlife farming.\u00a0",
            "Easing the blow to those areas from the elimination of such a major industry will be a difficult proposition, not to mention the question of what to do with the millions of animals involved. Some Chinese wildlife farmers complained that they have been ordered to continue caring for the animals and sanitizing their facilities even though sales have been banned and their income has dropped to zero.",
            "The UK Guardian thought the reaction to the wildlife consumption ban \u201cexposed the hitherto unknown size of the industry,\u201d which the central government was heavily promoting as a ticket out of poverty just a few weeks ago. The Guardian noted that at least 19,000 farms have been shut down across China since the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic, but only a fraction of that number of licenses were officially issued over the past decade.",
            "\u201cThere is little detail available about the animals farmed across China, but local press reports mention civet cats, bamboo rats, ostriches, wild boar, sika deer, foxes, ostriches, blue peacocks, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, wild geese, mallard ducks, red-billed geese, pigeons, and ring-necked pheasants,\u201d the Guardian reported.",
            "Civet cats are thought to have played an important role in spreading the SARS virus in the early 2000s. Bats were initially blamed for spreading the coronavirus, but attention later shifted to the pangolin, a scaly ant-eating mammal whose meat is considered a delicacy in some markets, while its scales are valued in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to these culinary and medical demands, pangolins are one of the most widely trafficked animals in the world, and they frequently appear on the bill of fare at wet markets."

China is just days away from Lundar New Year celebrations, a time when millions of Chinese typically travel to their familial hometowns, gather for parades, eat out, go to the movies, and shop. Last year, Chinese people spent around $150 billion on restaurants and shopping over the week-long holiday, according to official figures.\u00a0Spending on domestic travel and tourism for the holiday was around $118 billion.",

            "China\u2019s consumer spending and services sector are now much bigger, which in most circumstances is a good thing. But it makes the country far more vulnerable to a downturn in consumer spending. And travel and tourism account for 5 percent of GDP, up from around 2 percent in 2003.",

            "\u201cThe U.S. travel restrictions on China and criticism of China\u2019s quarantine strategy to contain the COVID-19 have been seen as a racist politicization of the epidemic,\u201d China\u2019s state-run Global Times declared on Wednesday, without demonstrating that anyone other than themselves sees the situation that way.",
            "The Chinese Communist paper went on to attack American health care, presumably to distract from the mounting horror stories about how China is dealing with the epidemic. To the Global Times, it is healthy America that is trying to distract the rest of the world from China\u2019s narrative of the epidemic:",
            "The US is the only major country that doesn\u2019t guarantee healthcare to its citizens as a human right. It\u2019s estimated about 30,000 people in the US die every year because they can\u2019t afford medical treatment, according to Physicians for a National Health Program. In the midst of such an incomplete system, it is unfortunately easy to understand why there are so many deaths from the seasonal flu.",
            "To distract from this travesty, it is easy to understand why the US corporate media, with similar profit motivations as the drug and pharmaceutical companies, would rather sensationalize COVID-19 than adequately focus on domestic health disasters. Fear helps generate profit and distracts Americans from understanding the social problems around them.",
            "After once again quoting politically useful praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 itself under scrutiny for prioritizing good relations with Beijing over frank discussions of the coronavirus threat \u2013 the Global Times claimed \u201cbigotry\u201d and \u201cimperialism\u201d are the only reasons China gets hassled about health crises that are covered without \u201ccompassion\u201d by Western media:",
            "The yellow peril stereotype, borrowed from Europe by American white supremacist writers in the 19th century, has long affected the Western cultural psyche. The idea that \u201csneaky Asians\u201d would destroy Western nations became a racist trope used to justify hostility toward societies exploited by colonization and imposed underdevelopment. This explains modern-day delusions from US Senator Tom Cotton about biological warfare.",
            "In spite of that chronic underdevelopment however, China has come a long way since achieving sovereignty. Though ever-evolving and still in development, China\u2019s healthcare system has worked to deliver free medical treatment to all COVID-19 patients. The government constructed a COVID-19 focused improvised hospital within 10 days. The lockdown of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak in Central China\u2019s Hubei Province, has allowed for the first decline in new cases in weeks. Taking decisive steps has helped China, and specifically Wuhan, repel initial mistakes and help stabilize the virus outbreak.",
            "An even more heated Global Times screed on Tuesday accused American politicians, corporations, and media of using the coronavirus story to \u201cpromote white supremacist racism and the advantage of their political system\u201d by \u201cfabricating\u201d a treat from China against the free world.",
            "This story included China\u2019s latest obsessive mention of influenza deaths in the United States, a talking point that ignores the fact that the coronavirus turned out to be much more dangerous than the flu and far more dangerous than the Chinese Communist Party was willing to admit until recently.",
            "The Global Times folded the coronavirus into Beijing\u2019s standard political narrative that jealous Western powers, especially the United States, are peddling \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and \u201cbashing China\u201d to thwart its ascension to great power status. This particular iteration of the Beijing narrative included a veiled threat that \u201cattempts to force China into a downfall will backfire\u201d because so much of the global industrial chain runs through China, thanks to decades of globalism.",
            "The Global Times was especially contemptuous of prominent China critics like White House adviser Peter Navarro and Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, all of whom the Chinese paper comically branded as \u201cneoconservatives\u201d:",
            "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro once described China as a \u201cdisease incubator,\u201d a claim regarded by many as racist and beyond the moral baseline of human civilization.",

            "Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai dismissed to the biological weapons theory as \u201cabsolutely crazy,\u201d and warned such allegations could stir up suspicion, rumors, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and could \u201charm our joint efforts to combat the virus.\u201d",

            "The latter slam on Cotton is amusing not just because the Global Times thinks one random Twitter user can humble a senator, but because Chinese readers of the Global Times cannot access Twitter legally since their government bans the platform.",
            "As for Senator Rubio, he annoyed the Chinese Communists by accusing the World Health Organization of being unduly concerned with Beijing\u2019s feelings instead of pulling out all the stops to combat the coronavirus, and he wants WHO to extend membership status to Taiwan, a move bitterly opposed by China because it would confer national legitimacy on what the Chinese see as a rogue province.",
            "\u201cRubio has an emotional affinity with, in additional to financial support of, Taiwan, because they both have a tendency to betray their homeland,\u201d sneered a Chinese academic quoted by the Global Times. By \u201cRubio\u2019s homeland,\u201d he meant Cuba, the Communist nation from which Rubio\u2019s family fled.",
            "The Global Times castigated U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross for supposedly welcoming the coronavirus epidemic as an opportunity to reclaim American jobs lost to China, and American businessman Kyle Bass expressing a wish to \u201clet the Chinese virus rampage through the ranks of the Global Times and the rest of the Communist Party.\u201d\u00a0",
            "As usual, the Chinese state paper left out some important context: Ross began by expressing condolences for the coronavirus and saying he did not want to \u201ctalk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,\u201d but he thought business leaders would take note of the pattern of disease epidemics disrupting Chinese supply chains.\u00a0",
            "Bass later deleted his tweet because he \u201cfelt that it was too harsh for the rank-and-file\u201d employees of the Global Times, but he said the paper itself was still a \u201csimple belligerent tabloid designed to stir controversy with western media and commentators,\u201d and he insisted he would never apologize to a Chinese regime that proved itself a \u201cdisgrace to humanity\u201d by arresting and\u00a0 punishing early whistleblowers on the Wuhan virus such as the late Dr. Li Wenliang.",
            "China\u2019s remorseless efforts to spin the coronavirus epidemic to its advantage, frequently using bits of rhetoric it gleans from American politicians and media \u2013 like the constant attacks on the U.S. healthcare system launched by Democrats seeking to take control of it \u2013 are unlikely to convince people around the world who can see with their own eyes that Beijing concealed the damaging truth about the epidemic for as long as it could, at a cost to the rest of the world that would be much greater without the travel restrictions China despises."

And this includes building strong, cooperative relationships with nations around the world to prevent and prepare for pandemics and other global emergencies that cross borders. The Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health must be given all ofthe resources necessary to do their job, free of political interference.

Since then, the virus has spread to every province in the country and to places outside of communist rule like Hong Kong and Macau. To help contain the outbreak, Chinese officials have implemented strict lockdowns forcing many people to work from home. Those who cannot do so, like factory workers who need access to materials and machinery, have simply not been able to work.",

Former Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong \u2013 a loyalist to dictator Xi Jinping recently appointed head of the Communist Party in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located \u2013 implemented a ban from being out in public throughout Wuhan and several other cities in the province. According to the South China Morning Post, Ying imposed what he called the \u201cstrictest 24-hour lock-down management,\u201d allowing individuals to leave their homes only in cases of emergency and to buy food and necessary supplies every three days.

He finally instituted a ban from individuals from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, in Friday, over a week after the Wuhan government instituted a complete shutdown in travel into or out of the city. On Monday, after the man\u2019s death in his country, Duterte expanded the ban to prohibit non-Philippine citizens from entering the country if they had traveled to all of China.",

According to the\u00a0Philippine Star, the man\u2019s wife was the first documented case of coronavirus in the Philippines, tested after they both arrived from the virus\u2019s originating city. The man reportedly also contracted a strain of influenza while suffering from the new coronavirus, exacerbating the respiratory infection caused by the first virus.",
            "The two join dozens of suspected coronavirus patients. One particularly concerning case revealed last week was of a 24-year-old man who died of pneumonia whose tests have not yet returned conclusively. The man was an HIV carrier, which likely complicated his illness, coronavirus carrier or not.",
            "The late man is not a confirmed coronavirus patient. Philippine authorities told reporters on Sunday that they did not have enough testing kits to check, but that his wife was tested and confirmed to be carrying the virus, so the government is \u201cfor sure\u201d documenting his death as part of the coronavirus outbreak, Philippine Department of Health officials said. They also insisted that, as the one confirmed case and the other highly suspected were both individuals from Wuhan, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in the Philippines.",

Of those,\u00a0Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that 67 are in isolation and another ten have been \u201cdischarged but under strict monitoring,\u201d suggesting tests have come back negative but doctors are not confident enough to fully clear them. A larger number, 30 people, were confirmed to have tested negative for the virus. The remainder\u2019s results are pending.",

Health officials suddenly revealed not just that a second case existed, but that the patient had died. Then Duque, the health secretary, also revealed that the couple had traveled to three islands in the Philippines before being identified as patients, potentially exposing a significant percentage of the country\u2019s population.",
            "Outrage had already begun to stir within a week of the Chinese government announcing the existence of the virus \u2013 which occurred nearly a month after Beijing privately alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) of the outbreak. Duterte and his administration repeatedly rejected the idea of a travel ban and openly admitted that he feared the Chinese Communist Party would be offended by one.",

It could include China but at this time, I am not for it. It would not be fair.\u201d",
            "A day later, he imposed a limited travel ban only on Chinese nationals coming from Hubei province and other affected places in China. All 31 provinces of China have documented cases of coronavirus. Following the revelation that a man had likely died after contracting the virus in Wuhan \u2013 and two days after Trump \u2013 Duterte expanded his ban to have it mirror the American ban. Anyone without Philippine citizenship who has traveled to China, Hong Kong, or Macau within the last two weeks cannot enter the Philippines until further notice.",

The West has already proven its vindictive and anxious mentality with a large-scale propaganda war against China. Western media constantly wages smear campaigns against the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Xinjiang and Tibet, two of China\u2019s autonomous regions.",

They have acted out of their old habits as they demean China and its people. But China has taken swift, effective and successful measures to curb the outbreak of NCP. The Chinese government has spared no efforts in this regard, including quarantining cities and constructing a 1,000-bed hospital in just 10 days.",
            "China has stopped at nothing in its attempt to prevent the further spreading of the virus and safeguard the world from the contagion. China\u2019s comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures have helped the world make necessary preparations to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic.",
            "Like most CCP spin, the Global Times cited politically useful statements from the World Health Organization (WHO) to the effect that China has done a great job of controlling the epidemic, so draconian measures like travel bans and evacuating foreign citizens from the outbreak area are unnecessary. The rest of the world has ignored WHO\u2019s advice on these subjects with remarkable consistency, scrambling to shut down travel to China and get foreigners out of Hubei province as quickly as possible.",

They would like to hamper trade and business in China, thereby isolating the second-largest economy from the rest of the world,\u201d the Chinese state paper charged.",
            "This was followed by the most bizarre argument deployed by the CCP, namely that concerns about the coronavirus are overhyped because there are so many illnesses and deaths from the flu and other diseases. Flip that argument around: why would countries already dealing with millions of cases of influenza wish to import a new and even more virulent disease from China, adding to their medical woes, especially when the CCP has clearly been dishonest about how contagious and deadly the Wuhan virus is?",

The death toll in China passed 1,000 on Tuesday, with 42,708 admitted infections, plus 393 cases outside China with one known fatality.

            "The team came to Spain for pre-season training and doesn\u2019t know when it will be able to return home.",
            "Players haven\u2019t seen their relatives in more than two months. One of them lost a family member because of the virus.",
            "Their arrival prompted fears among local residents in the midst of the rapidly spreading outbreak. They had to be repeatedly tested before concerns about their condition abated.",
            "It hasn\u2019t been easy for the nearly 50 members of the Wuhan Zall team, but on Sunday they will get some reprieve from their ordeal by attending the Spanish league \u201ccl\u00e1sico\u201d between Real Madrid and Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. The team will also tour the famed venue in Madrid on Monday.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s really a well-deserved reward for them,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, the team\u2019s Spanish coach, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. \u201cIt will be an experience that without a doubt they will never forget. They have been training and training day after day, distracted by the situation back home, so it will be a nice break for them to watch a game like this between Real Madrid and Barcelona.\u201d",

            "The team will be at the Bernab\u00e9u on an invitation from Real Madrid and La Liga, which has a partnership with the Chinese Super League, the country\u00b4s main soccer competition. The league has been suspended because of the coronavirus and is not expected to resume until mid-April. Wuhan Zall was originally scheduled to stay in its preseason base in southern Spain until mid-February, just before the league\u00b4s planned start. Now it is expected to remain in the country at least until the end of March.",
            "Other Chinese clubs are in a similar situation in countries like Thailand, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, though Wuhan Zall is actually based in the city at the centre of the outbreak that has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide, most of them in China.",
            "Wuhan Zall arrived in Spain at the end of January but previously practised in the Chinese city of Guanghzou, nearly 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) away from Wuhan. Although the team was far from the initial outbreak, Spanish health authorities had to come out publicly to say there was no reason for local citizens to be concerned about the squad\u00b4s arrival. Three players arrived from China later and had to stay in quarantine and be tested for the virus before joining the rest of the group.",
            "\u201cThe fear of the unknown obviously always exists,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI understood those who were reticent about the team coming to Spain. But with time it became clear that there was no problem with the team being here.\u201d",
            "Gonz\u00e1lez, a former striker who had played in China, said his focus has been to take the players\u00b4 minds away from the situation at home. Going to the \u201ccl\u00e1sico\u201d was one way of doing that, as was the decision to give them 10 days of vacation while in Spain.",
            "\u201cI honestly try to talk about the subject (virus) as little as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they are already talking about it all the time, in their rooms, with their relatives back home. I don\u2019t want to talk about it as well every time I see them. I try to make training as fun as possible so I can see them smiling a bit.\u201d",
            "Gonz\u00e1lez also has tried to schedule a couple of friendlies each week to keep the players motivated and not too bored with endless training sessions.",
            "The Spanish coach said he was amazed with how the players have dealt with the situation.",
            "\u201cThey have been training without knowing when the league will start again, coping with family problems back home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very easy to disconnect from your profession, very easy, but they have been giving a spectacular lesson of professionalism.",
            "\u201cTheir attitude has been admirable,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think most of us would react the same way in a situation like this. They have been away from home for more than two months, they couldn\u2019t enjoy Christmas with their families, they are talking to their relatives on the phone every day and seeing that they are locked at home and can\u00b4t live a normal life. That has to affect them psychologically.\u201d",
            "The 53-year-old Gonz\u00e1lez, who also played and coached at M\u00e1laga in Spain, said his experience with the Chinese club has been unique.",
            "\u201cYou think that you\u00b4ve experienced almost everything in life over the years, but this case is special,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep learning from these players, about their behavior, about their way of dealing with this. It makes you think about the limits of the human capacity and about professionalism.\u201d",
            "About 14 players from his squad are originally from Wuhan, and the grandmother of one was among the deaths caused by the virus in the city.",
            "\u201cIt brings you closer to the problem,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cIt was a very painful moment for everyone. But like everything in life, you have to try to move on. He couldn\u00b4t go back to Wuhan.\u201d",
            "Wuhan Zall will be playing in the Chinese first division for the second straight season. It finished sixth in the Super League last season. One of its international players is Portuguese defender Daniel Carri\u00e7o, who joined from Spanish club Sevilla this month. Four of Wuhan Zall\u00b4s players are with China\u00b4s national team and will be leaving the training camp along with some staff members to play in a World Cup qualifying game.",
            "The team will move from its original training facility near the southern coastal city of M\u00e1laga to the nearby tourist destination of Marbella. Last year, it had also spent its preseason near M\u00e1laga.",
            "Gonz\u00e1lez said training conditions have been perfect in Spain, but he hopes the team will get to leave soon.",
            "Just not before the Real Madrid-Barcelona match on Sunday, which will be the highlight of the team\u00b4s trip so far.",
            "\u201cFor anyone who likes football, going to a \u2018cl\u00e1sico\u2019 is something very special,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cImagine what a great experience it will be. It will be a very special day.\u201d",

            "The Party, in other words, is using its extensive surveillance infrastructure \u2014 more commonly used to silence and imprison dissidents \u2014 to track potential virus carriers. Similarly, the\u00a0Global Times portrays the Party\u2019s propaganda mechanisms as beneficial to public health, as local officials in Inner Mongolia \u201chave made many\u00a0Putonghua [Mandarin]-Mongolian bilingual short videos\u201d about the virus.",
            "The\u00a0Global Times admitted it is almost entirely unclear if these communist efforts have done anything beneficial for the country, but praised them anyway.",
            "\u201cIt is not yet time to say exactly what role primary-level Party organizations have played in the current fight against the epidemic. However, this may be a good chance for some foreigners and foreign media to learn more about China,\u201d the newspaper suggested. \u201cAs China is fighting the epidemic, some Western media are badmouthing and blackening the Chinese system. We hope that they can see the efficient operations of China\u2019s primary-level Party organizations.\u201d",
            "The state newspaper notably omits in its description of the Communist Party as a force for good against the viral outbreak the mounting evidence that the Party and its leader, dictator Xi Jinping, actively conspired to suppress the true number of coronavirus carriers and neglected to properly shut down at-risk events and locations in Wuhan in a timely manner. Reports from within Wuhan suggested in late January that locals were aware of a viral infection spreading as early as mid-December, but had no information regarding it, especially the key detail that the virus causing it was a newly identified one. Health workers have anonymously denounced Wuhan officials for not making them aware, which led to hospitals believing there was no reason to quarantine or otherwise isolate patients with the telltale flu-like symptoms of the new coronavirus. As the virus is now believed to be highly contagious through moisture particles in the area, dozens of health workers and hospital patients are believed to have been infected needlessly due to lack of isolation.",
            "Once the Chinese government began moving to contain the virus, reports indicated that it was deliberately limiting access to testing kits. Individuals with fevers, coughs, or other potential coronavirus symptoms reported being turned away from hospitals; only patients approved by the Communist Party were allowed to be tested for coronavirus, suggesting that dozens, if not hundreds, of virus carriers were never tested and thus never formed part of the official case tally.",
            "The rejection of patients at Wuhan hospitals spawned widespread public outrage, perhaps most dramatically illustrated by video published by the\u00a0South China Morning Post of a man with a fever, rejected for coronavirus testing, coughing in the face of health workers in revenge.",
            "Last week, China\u2019s National Health Commission claimed that the number of new cases of the virus per day was declining, suggesting that the outbreak had peaked despite academic and medical experts stating it would take months for the virus to start spreading more slowly. At the time, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization claimed that 6,061 cases of the virus had been documented and 132 people had died.",
            "Today, that number stands at 20,676 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection and 427 deaths, only two of which occurred outside of China (one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong).",

Not true. His behavior at the CDC on Friday spoke volumes about his mindset. He wore a campaign hat to the event. He asked about Fox\u2019s ratings. He insulted the Democratic governor of Washington state and brought up the Ukraine scandal. Most of the news coverage of this visit downplayed just how strange it was. That is a problem. We have to describe reality as it actually is. Not shy away from the abhorrent responses we\u2019re seeing from the commander in chief. Some of his aides are saying this is contained. That\u2019s a lie. Thankfully there\u2019s been fact checks on that point.\u201d",

Trump and the news media have a tendency to make everything about Trump. But this virus story is only a little bit about Trump. Should he be doing things differently? Yes. For example, the CDC says older Americans should limit travel, but he\u2019s\u2019s not amplifying that message. He should be. Right now. He can tweet about it right now. The president should lead or else he should get out of the way. By all means, sir, please don\u2019t go out of your way to make a bad situation worse. Lead or get out of the way. Don\u2019t be an obstacle. Maybe just stay on the golf course. So, that\u2019s the story about the president. But the press should point out when he is an obstacle and then move on.

            "The Spain-based\u00a0Diario de Cuba newspaper highlighted the column, which cited an alleged Spanish journalist whose sole evidence for the theory was a remark from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that an ongoing health emergency in China might force companies to do more business with America. The newspaper also noted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s repeated warnings that the Chinese Communist Party is a threat to global freedom and democracy as somehow indicating that Washington is engaging in terrorist activity.",
            "Orfilio Pel\u00e1ez, the\u00a0Granma \u201cjournalist\u201d responsible for promoting the theory, wrote that the Spanish conspiracy theory in question posits that \u201cthe coronavirus could be a germ created in laboratories in the United States as a biological weapon of economic war unleashed by Washington against China.\u201d The piece goes on to offer no evidence that the Pentagon had been working on any such weapon in recent memory or research on the novel coronavirus suggesting it did not occur in nature. Instead, it offered \u201cvarious recent declarations by high-ranking White House officials and an increasingly intense international anti-China media campaign\u201d as proof.",
            "\u201cI think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to U.S., probably some to Mexico as well,\u2019\u2019 Commerce Secretary Ross said on television of the coronavirus outbreak in January, a remark that\u00a0Granma posited could indicate biological terrorism.",
            "Drifting away from the material in the alleged Spanish blog post that the flagship Cuban government newspaper based its initial story on, Pel\u00e1ez then redirected attention to Cuba by claiming that late dictator Fidel Castro was the first \u201cvictim\u201d of American biological warfare.",
            "\u201cPerhaps one of the intended first victims of this dark mode of aggression was Commander in Chief Fidel Castro at the beginning of the Revolution, when the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) designed a plan to contaminate a scuba suit that would supposedly be used by the Cuban leader,\u201d\u00a0Granma\u00a0alleged. There is no evidence that the CIA ever executed this alleged plan.",
            "Granma also revived the many colorful theories of the CIA allegedly trying to poison Fidel Castro with cigars, without attempting to link these stories to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak of 2020 in any way.",
            "After an extensive discussion of alleged CIA bioterrorism activities, the\u00a0Granma articled concluded: \u201cthere is no evidence at this time that the coronavirus is part of a biological terrorist act by the United States.\u201d",
            "Chinese scientists identified the virus responsible for the current outbreak as a yet-unidentified form of coronavirus dubbed 2019-nCoV to distinguish it from other coronaviruses: the common cold, the virus responsible for Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and others, most which cause respiratory illness. The novel coronavirus prompts fever, difficulty breathing, and other flu-like symptoms in carriers. It can lead to pneumonia or death.",
            "The virus originated in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. Experts believe it entered the first human carrier through exposure to or consumption of game at a wild meat market in the city. Wuhan Communist Party authorities shut the market down on January 1, nearly a month before they decided to warn the public of a highly contagious, deadly disease.",
            "\u00a0At press time, over 1,000 people have died after contracting the virus. The total number of officially documented cases stands at 43,138, though experts believe the real number to be much higher, citing multiple reports of the Communist Party deliberately failing to test likely carriers.",
            "The Cuban conspiracy theory surrounding the virus is far from the last, and not the only one blaming America. Russian television has floated the idea that America is trying to sink both the Russian and Chinese economies by deploying an alleged biological weapon. Channel One, a national broadcast network, aired a conspiracy theory contending that the presence of the word \u201ccorona\u201d in the name of the virus \u2013 \u201ccrown\u201d in many languages, including Russian \u2013 is a nod to President Donald Trump\u2019s time as a beauty pageant owner. It did not address the fact that the common cold is also a coronavirus and that the name existed long before Trump took office, but did give time to an \u201cexpert\u201d contending that the virus could not have been created in nature, according to the BBC translation of the broadcast.",
            "Another Russian outlet, the state online publication Zvezda, reportedly published an article in January linking the virus to trade talks between Washington and Beijing.",
            "\u201cRight after the Soviet collapse, the presence of American bio-laboratories has so far been confirmed in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Where else\u2014only the State Department knows, though it insists that these are harmless groups tasked with developing medical devices,\u201d the outlet alleged.",
            "At press time, English-language state media outlets in China have not prominently addressed these conspiracy theories, choosing instead to blame the United States and greater West for an alleged surge in \u201cracism\u201d against Asians as a result of the outbreak. The conspiracy theory media outlets have addressed in China is one blaming Beijing for the virus. At least one conspiracy theory claimed the coronavirus shared traits with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), suggesting it was built in a laboratory. Wuhan is home to one of China\u2019s most advanced microbiology research centers, fueling unsubstantiated theories that a biological weapon accidentally escaped.",

            "In the latest episode of his HBO show, host John Oliver slammed President Donald Trump over his response to the coronavirus but went comparatively easy on China for its cover-ups and attempts to silence government whistleblowers.",
            "On Sunday\u2019s episode of Last Week Tonight, Oliver devoted nearly five straight minutes to mocking President Trump for \u201cpeddling false hope\u201d and failing to speak clearly during recent press conferences on the\u00a0coronavirus.",
            "In contrast, the British comedian spent just 20 seconds\u00a0addressing Beijing\u2019s cover-ups during the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, which he admitted helped the virus spread and infect thousands of people.",
            "In his monologue, Oliver made fun of President Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Vice President Mike Pence to lead the government\u2019s coronavirus efforts. He also mocked the White House press conference that took place Wednesday, calling it a \u201cdebacle\u201d and showing selectively edited clips from the event.",
            "",
            "\u201cThis was a press conference meant to calm the nation, and with the most basic question of who would be running things seemingly up in the air, he just fucked right off. Look, I know we\u2019re used to only seeing Businessman Trump, but it is nice to occasionally get a glimpse of the absentee father in him too.\u201d",
            "Oliver also accused President Trump of \u201clying\u201d about the coronavirus but didn\u2019t provide any evidence that the president told lies. The comedian added that the president is \u201cpeddling false hope\u201d about the disease.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s also concerning that Trump\u2019s main focus when discussing the virus seems to be downplaying any potentially bad news,\u201d he said.",
            "Oliver continued, during his six-minute Trump-bashing rant, to make fun of the president for saying that flu viruses tend to wane during warmer months, which the comedian later conceded was true. Still, he added, \u201cthis is a bad time to have president who can\u2019t speak clearly.\u201d",
            "But when it came to holding China\u201ds Communist dictatorship accountable, Oliver spent a mere 10 seconds on Beijing\u2019s slow response to the initial outbreak, and then another 10 seconds on its efforts to silence whistleblowers.",
            "\u201cInitially, the Chinese government wasn\u2019t just slow to respond. Officials tried to silence and punish medical professionals who tried to raise the alarm, which almost certainly helped the disease to spread.\u201d",
            "Later, Oliver briefly mentioned the Chinese doctor who blew the whistle on Beijing but who was silenced and eventually died of the virus.",
            "\u201cDespite the government\u2019s effort at containment, over 2700 people have now died in China, among them Dr. Li Wenliang, an early whistleblower silenced by officials who has since become a symbol for citizens\u2019 anger at their government\u2019s response.\u201d",
            "The rest of Oliver\u2019s monologue offered muted approval of China\u2019s leaders: \u201cAnd when the Chinese leadership finally decided to act, it moved aggressively, putting 50 million people on lockdown.\u201d",
            "Oliver felt the wrath of China\u2019s Communist dictatorship in 2018 when he dared to criticize President Xi Jinping. As a result, mentions of the British comedian were blocked on China\u2019s most popular social media sites. Oliver had criticized President Xi for China\u2019s treatment of the Muslim minority Uighur population, as well as for the recent removal of term limits for China\u2019s president.",

            "Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing \u2013 Xi\u2019s alma mater \u2013 wrote in a damning article published in various overseas Chinese-language news sites that Communist Party leaders had \u201cput politics ahead of the people.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe political system has collapsed under the tyranny, and a governance system [made up] of bureaucrats, which has taken [the party] more than 30 years to build has floundered,\u201d he wrote in his piece.\u00a0 \u201cThe mess in Hubei is only the tip of the iceberg and it\u2019s the same with every province.\u201d",
            "He also made the point that China\u2019s tight system of control and its initial refusal to warn people about the possible outbreak meant that people were ill-prepared.",
            "This frustration appears to be shared by Chinese people, many of whom have taken to social media platforms to express their anger at government officials for failing to provide enough information and for mishandling the distribution of vital medical supplies to doctors and nurses.",
            "\u201cAll chances of public discussions have been smothered, and so was the original alarm mechanism in society,\u201d Xu explained.\u00a0\u201cThe anger of the people has erupted like a volcano, and the angry people will no longer be afraid,\u201d",
            "Xu is a well-known critic of the Chinese Communist Party, having last year been suspended from teaching at Tsinghua University for publishing an article that criticized the party\u2019s decision to scrap the two-term limit for presidents so that Xi can effectively rule the country by decree indefinitely.

            "Thanks to the socialist regime of dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela has deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party, which has invested millions in keeping him in power. China is responsible for building a social surveillance system known as the \u201cFatherland card\u201d for Maduro to help track dissidents and deny them food and basic goods. China has also attempted to get Venezuela to sign onto its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d a sprawling international bid for Beijing to build and control most of the world\u2019s transportation infrastructure, but Caracas\u2019 ongoing economic crisis has made it impossible for Maduro to sign onto any major project.",
            "The ties between the Chinese Communist Party and Maduro mean that travel between the two countries occurs regularly, potentially exposing Venezuela to the ongoing outbreak of a newly documented coronavirus in China. The virus, originating in the central city of Wuhan, has infected over 20,000 people and killed nearly 500 since the Communist Party announced the discovery of the virus on January 20.",
            "Given the potential of a traveler from China bringing the virus into Venezuela \u2013 and the state of abandon and collapse that the Venezuelan healthcare system currently finds itself in \u2013 the National Assembly approved a measure that would create a protocol for how to handle a potential coronavirus case independent of the Maduro regime.",

            "\u201cThe precarious health situation in the country make us require these alerts because there is the possibility of coronavirus reaching Venezuela,\u201d he concluded.",
            "The novel coronavirus is highly contagious through moisture particles ejected while coughing, breathing, or sneezing. Experts believe that it may be contagious even before a carrier has visible symptoms, which tend to include fever, coughing, and body aches. Washing hands, wearing face masks, and staying away from crowded areas are pivotal measures to control the outbreak.",
            "Another lawmaker, Jos\u00e9 Trujillo, noted on Tuesday that, even if the coronavirus outbreak had reached the country, it would be impossible for Venezuela to know because hospitals do not have testing kits. The World Health Organization (WHO) is organizing the global response; as a United Nations body, it incorrectly identified Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the nation\u2019s head of state, excluding legitimate President Juan Guaid\u00f3. It remains unclear how the WHO would be able to distribute humanitarian aid or testing supplies in Venezuela given that it does not recognize Guaid\u00f3 and Maduro\u2019s regime refuses to acknowledge that the country has needed humanitarian aid for years.",
            "\u201cIn Venezuela, we don\u2019t even have a way to test [someone] to detect coronavirus,\u201d Trujillo noted. \u201cPrevention is key and in this country it is almost impossible to do it. International organizations should send aid to deal with this virus and avoid a tragedy.\u201d",
            "He added, \u201cVenezuela will not escape the threat because we have alliances with Asian nations and the virus lives for 14 days before being detected [in someone\u2019s body], so it can reach the country. The virus is a genetic alteration, but the truth isn\u2019t being told to the world.\u201d",
            "Maduro\u2019s regime has downplayed that threat, claiming that it has implemented the necessary safeguards to prevent the virus from ravaging the country. Maduro\u2019s \u201chealth minister\u201d Carlos Alvarado said on Monday that the WHO\u2019s subgroup in the region, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), would be sending testing kits to Venezuela this week. He added that Venezuela has requested that other countries identify coronavirus patients before they board planes to the country. He insisted the regime had yet to identify a coronavirus case in Venezuela.",
            "China\u2019s state-run news service Xinhua highlighted Maduro expressing solidarity with the Communist Party on the outbreak.",
            "\u201cThe entire world looks on in awe at the energetic determination with which the Chinese government has met the sanitary protocols recommended by international organizations specialized in health to control the propagation of the virus,\u201d a statement from Maduro this week read.",
            "The Venezuelan Red Cross has expressed panic at Maduro\u2019s coronavirus preparedness. Last week, the president of the organization, Mario Villarroel, warned that \u201cwe are not ready to fully combat this disease,\u201d noting the dire state of Venezuela\u2019s socialist healthcare system.",
            "\u201cWe are calling for the prevention of the coronavirus. We are not ready to fully combat this disease. This is something that the Health Ministry has to prepare. Neither the medicines nor the treatment necessary are here,\u201d Villarroel said.",

Amputations became increasingly common as the economy began to rot under Maduro in 2014, as antibiotics ran short, and nearly every medicine on the WHO\u2019s list of necessary, basic medicines is no longer available. Vaccines are also in short supply, resulting in outbreaks of diseases Venezuela had eradicated before socialism, like malaria, measles, and\u00a0diptheria.\u00a0Patients living with chronic diseases like diabetes or HIV have little to no access to necessary treatment."

As attorney general, I created the China initiative to investigate the criminal activities of China. In the last four years of the Obama administration, there were no prosecutions involving China. There have been 50 since President Trump took office.\u201d",

Bradley Byrne (R-AL) and former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville, reflected on his conversations with then-candidate Trump, noting that when Trump took power, he was not reluctant to use tariffs to force China to the bargaining table.",
            "\u201cHe and I talked about it on the airplane in various private conversations,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cWhat I believe that fully understand is if we stand firm, China needs us far more than we need them. They have this huge $400 billion-plus trade surplus with us. If they could not sell into our market, their economy would go into a major recession almost immediately, whereas we can buy products made in the United States, made in Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Philippines. It might cost a few cents more. They\u2019re far more friendly to us and don\u2019t cheat at the level China does. President Trump is the first president willing to play that card and actually impose tariffs on China of substantial amounts to bring them to the table, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve come to the table for the first round of agreements.\u201d",

My opponent Tommy Tuberville opposes tariffs. He is a 100% free trader. He says he doesn\u2019t agree with the president\u2019s position with regard to China. There are others in Washington just like that. This is not President Trump\u2019s philosophy. His philosophy is a good president owes his allegiance to the people of the United States \u2014 to negotiate agreements that protect their interests and not some theory of free trade.\u201d",

They\u2019ll invest in Chinese companies, in Vietnamese companies. They don\u2019t care where it is made, as long as they make their profit.

But yes \u2014 you simply have to live in reality, not theory. And the theory is anything that is a few cents cheaper, you should buy the cheaper product, wherever it is made.\u00a0 We don\u2019t often understand they are subsidized by foreign governments. They also pay slave wages in those foreign countries.\u201d",

You don\u2019t make our medicines.\u2019 We can make all of those here, and it won\u2019t cost much more money if it costs any,\u201d he continued. \u201cSometimes, it might be less.

Xi used the epidemic as leverage to demand total obedience from his subjects at a moment when popular discontent with his rule has reached an all-time high, shifting blame for the outbreak and various abuses of public trust to lower-level local officials.",
            "China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news service summarized key points from the speech (referred to as \u201cthe article\u201d) on Saturday:",
            "The article stresses the importance of securing success in the prevention and control work, pointing out that the outcome of the epidemic prevention and control directly affects people\u2019s lives and health, the overall economic and social stability and the country\u2019s opening-up.",
            "Resources for treatment, prevention and protection must be sent to the front line of the battle against the epidemic and priority should be given to meet the needs of frontline medical staff and patients, according to the article.",
            "All-out efforts should be made to improve the admission and survival rates, and reduce the infection and mortality rates, the article says.",
            "The article underlines the need to safeguard social stability, the promotion of public education and communication, as well as ensuring a stable economic performance.",
            "It also stresses improving the country\u2019s emergency management system and capacity of handling urgent, difficult, dangerous and important tasks.",
            "The state-run Global Times conjured up some \u201canalysts\u201d who were floored by Xi\u2019s magnificent speech and praised his \u201ctransparent\u201d leadership on the coronavirus, even though the big political story in China over the past two months has been Xi disappearing and leaving Premier Li Kequiang holding the virus hot potato:",
            "Analysts noted that Xi, the leader of the Party and the country, is leading the fight against the COVID-19 in a very transparent and responsible manner, directly addressing public discontent and meeting people\u2019s expectations. It is very rarely seen that a speech by the president at a senior-level meeting included so many details, direct instructions and harsh criticisms on the problems, especially during the fight against the virus.",
            "At the very beginning of the article, Xi noted that he has made requirements on work to prevent and control the COVID-19 on January 7 since the outbreak started while presiding a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.\u00a0",
            "Chinese experts said that the CPC Central Committee is playing the most significant role in this war on the virus which needs to mobilize a country with a 1.4 billion population.",
            "\u201cCOVID-19\u201d is the medical terminology for the virus. The Chinese are working very hard on getting the rest of the world to stop referring to it as the \u201cWuhan virus,\u201d for obvious political reasons.",
            "The Global Times especially liked the part of Xi\u2019s speech where he demanded even greater levels of obedience from all quarters of Chinese government and society, blaming any perceived deficiencies in China\u2019s virus response on clumsy local officials who did not follow Beijing\u2019s orders quickly and completely:",
            "The article noted that \u201cParty committees and governments at all levels must firmly obey the centralized leadership of the CPC Central Committee,\u201d epidemic prevention and control is not an issue only related to medical care, but works of all aspects. It is a comprehensive war, and all effort must lend support to winning this battle in preventing and controlling the epidemic.",
            "The implementation of the CPC Central Committee\u2019s instructions at all levels is generally good, the article noted, but also stressed the need to strengthen areas of weakness and close loopholes exposed by the current epidemic.",
            "Shen Yi, head of Fudan University\u2019s Cyberspace Governance Research Institute, said that the article shows an honest and transparent attitude, as a very serious problem that was exposed since the beginning of the outbreak is that \u201ca few officials at local level governments didn\u2019t effectively implement the instructions from the CPC Central Committee and also didn\u2019t reflect the real situation at the time.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe CPC Central Committee is aware of a situation on January 7, but due to this kind of problem (inefficient implementation), it caused some loopholes and mistakes, and fortunately the Party has a strong capability of self-correction, and now the damage over the credibility of the government has been generally fixed and recovered,\u201d Song said.",
            "CNN suspected the \u201csituation on January 7\u201d described in the new Communist Party virus mythology was a reference to the massive banquet that was regrettably held in Wuhan just as the virus was exploding out of control. The first two weeks of January were a particularly grim chapter in the tale of the coronavirus, as it represented the last efforts of Chinese officials to pretend the situation was completely under control and the virus was not particularly dangerous.",
            "Under gale-force political spin pumped out by Xinhua and the Global Times, the new story is that Xi was secretly in control the whole time, but idiotic local officials (and an equally foolish team of researchers dispatched from Beijing that claimed the virus was under control on January 11) botched Xi\u2019s orders and misinformed him.",
            "Ultimately, however, the awkwardness of sharing some of the blame with Hubei officials might be preferable to admitting that Xi and those around him were potentially unaware or ill-informed about what was really going on.",
            "The Associated Press thought the new mythology made Xi and other top CCP officials vulnerable to criticism that they knew how dangerous the Wuhan virus was but did not take firm action until the epidemic was so huge that it could no longer be ignored:",
            "The disclosure of his speech indicates top leaders knew about the outbreak\u2019s potential severity at least two weeks before such dangers were made known to the public. It was not until late January that officials said the virus can spread between humans and public alarm began to rise.",
            "Zhang Lifan, a commentator in Beijing, said it\u2019s not clear why the speech was published now. One message could be that local authorities should take responsibility for failing to take effective measures after Xi gave instructions in early January. Alternatively, it may mean that Xi, as the top leader, is willing to take responsibility because he was aware of the situation, Zhang said.",
            "Bloomberg News found it \u201cperplexing\u201d that Xi would attempt a wholesale rewriting of coronavirus history, producing an altered timeline that most Chinese citizens know is false. Skeptics are greatly underestimating the CCP\u2019s ability to force its citizens to believe in edited versions of history, and the ability of Communist leaders to pin blame for their shortcomings on underlings. A great many local officials will be scapegoated to make Xi\u2019s new timeline stick, with some of them probably ending up in prison or worse, but there will be plenty of replacement officials to take their places.",
            "On Monday, Xinhua pumped out supplementary propaganda to cover Xi\u2019s flank, portraying the international community as dazzled by Xi\u2019s leadership and claiming the epidemic makes China look more responsible and transparent to the world community, not less. Amusingly, Xinhua had to turn to the general secretary of the Egyptian Communist Party to get a really good fawning quote about China\u2019s \u201creally impressive,\u201d \u201cresolute,\u201d and \u201cdecisive\u201d measures to battle the virus.",
            "Chinese state media on Monday claimed the Wuhan virus outbreak is coming under control, with fewer new cases reported for three consecutive days following a huge spike in new infections last week. Premier Li Kequiang said on Monday the threat of a pandemic has been \u201caverted.\u201d"

            "Doctors in Wuhan, China, identified the youngest known carrier of coronavirus on Wednesday: a 30-day-old infant whose mother tested positive for the virus while pregnant.",
            "China is confronting a rapidly accelerating outbreak of a previously unknown coronavirus that it acknowledged publicly on January 20, a month after locals in Wuhan said they began hearing of an illness spreading rapidly. Over 20,000 people have been diagnosed as carrying the new coronavirus and nearly 500 people have died, the majority of them in China. The virus has begun spreading from human to human in several Asian countries, however, including Thailand and Singapore.",
            "The new coronavirus is believed to be a relative of the common cold and the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, producing similar symptoms like fever, cough, and body aches. Those who have died have developed advanced pneumonia and are believed to be largely elderly people and those already suffering from prior illness. As China did not alert its health workers of the highly contagious nature of the virus, hospitals did not adequately isolate patients with flu-like symptoms before January 20, likely leading to widespread infection in at-risk populations already hospitalized.",
            "The\u00a0South China Morning Post cited the Communist Party\u2019s CCTV broadcaster Wednesday in confirming that a 30-hour infant tested positive for the virus in Wuhan, where it originated. The baby\u2019s mother also tested positive for the virus before giving birth, suggesting that the child could have been infected in the womb. Doctors are not yet certain, given the 30 hours in between birth and confirmation of infection, if the child was already carrying coronavirus in the womb or became infected after contact with the mother following birth.",
            "The infant suggests yet another avenue for the virus to spread. Currently, the virus is believed to spread most commonly through moisture particles in the area, meaning the breath of a carrier could infect someone. This makes the virus significantly more contagious than Ebola, for example, that can only be transmitted through extensive exposure to a carrier\u2019s blood. If the virus can reach a baby in the womb, it may also have the potential to complicate pregnancies like the Zika virus, which results in mild symptoms when passed to adults but severely deforms an unborn child\u2019s brain.",
            "The Wuhan newborn is among the 3,887 people confirmed as carriers of the new coronavirus on Wednesday, the highest number in any one day since the outbreak began. The total number of confirmed cases worldwide is currently at 24,629 and 492 people have died, all but two within China. The death toll between Tuesday and Wednesday, 65 people, is also the largest number in a single day, calling into question adamant assertions by Chinese state media and government officials last week that the rate of infection had started to decline.",
            "Outside of China, health authorities are concerned with preventing the virus from spreading in the wild, isolating individuals coming into outside countries from China. Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand have all documented cases of human-to-human transmission \u2013 that is, infections that occurred outside of the epicenter of the outbreak \u2013 alarming locals who fear they can become infected by being out in public in their home countries. Japan is also handling an outbreak that occurred on a cruise ship housing 3,700 passengers, quarantining the ship after a passenger tested positive for the virus upon returning from a vacation on the ship.",
            "Unrest in Hong Kong, already at near-peak levels before the viral outbreak due to increasingly belligerent political moves by Beijing, has swept the virus response into its storm. Thousands of health workers in the city are currently on strike in protest against Chief Executive Carrie Lam refusing to shut Hong Kong\u2019s border with China, choosing instead to keep some smaller points of entry open for those who commute to and from China regularly. As of Tuesday, 7,000 health workers were on strike. Health workers fear that they do not have the resources possible to adequately do their jobs if the border remain open, potentially flooding Hong Kong hospitals with patients from China. Tens of thousands of people crossed the border into Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK. One of two deaths outside of China occurred in Hong Kong; the other was a traveler from Wuhan in the Philippines.",
            "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the virus at its source,\u00a0even if we have more manpower, resources or more isolation wards, the problem cannot be solved,\u201d Winnie Yu of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said on Tuesday.",
            "The strike has yielded minimal results as Lam, inch by inch, has conceded some policy changes. On Wednesday, Lam announced that the government would quarantine any individual crossing the border from China for 14 days as of next Saturday.",
            "While Hong Kong residents demand to be sealed off from China, Taiwan has moved to seal itself off from Hong Kong, citing the open border as a security risk. Similar to Lam\u2019s new proposal, Taiwan will force any individual entering from Hong Kong or Macau into a 14-day quarantine to prevent the virus from spreading. This will also apply to individuals who visited China, Hong Kong, or Macau in the past 14 days but enter Taiwan from a third country.",
            "The Chinese Communist Party has bristled at these limitations in travel, largely blaming the United States for spreading \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cracism\u201d against Chinese people. The United States has banned any foreign national from entering the country if they have visited China in the past 14 days.",
            "The\u00a0People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the\u00a0Communist Party, called America \u201cextremely selfish and irresponsible\u201d for limiting travel and responding to the threat of Chinese imperialism despite the existence of the outbreak. The column was particularly outraged by a remark by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week, who deemed China a top global threat because of its use of its technological arms like Huawei to implement authoritarian technologies worldwide.",
            "\u201cThe rise of China, an oversized country under the strong leadership of the CPC, is an unstoppable historical process,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily declared. \u201cWhile there will be tests along the way, including this new coronavirus outbreak, the ultimate victory must be China\u2019s. To borrow a phrase, the only thing to fear is fear itself. As for the American politicians with evil intentions, time will see their defeat, and history will record their ugliness.\u201d",

            "Although figures for the entire border haven\u2019t been made public, it is likely that the number of Chinese nationals apprehended at the Mexican border is well over 4,000.\u00a0And, for every illegal alien who is caught at the border, there are at least three who make it in without getting caught.",
            "That means that, estimating conservatively, more than 12,000 Chinese nationals entered the country illegally across the southern border in FY 2019.\u00a0And none of them were screened for infectious diseases.\u00a0This year a similar number are sneaking into the United States\u2014coming from the country that is the origin of the coronavirus.",

Also in the group of affected lawmakers is reportedly a representative from Qom, where the first coronavirus cases were documented, who claimed Tehran was vastly underreporting the number of cases in that city and that its public health response was, at best, lackluster.",
            "The elite cases of coronavirus join a confirmed 2,336 cases in Iran and 66 deaths attributed to the Chinese coronavirus. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 92,220 cases and 3,129 deaths, most of them in China. In addition to China and Iran, Italy, South Korea, and Japan have documented the largest number of cases.",

In a press release Tuesday, the\u00a0People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), an anti-regime organization that operates globally, accused Tehran of downplaying the actual number of cases by a factor of 20. The group asserted that they had evidence for over 1,000 deaths attributable to the virus so far nationwide. The virus, the group claimed, is rapidly spreading in Iran\u2019s notorious prisons, where many languish for simple opposition to the Islamic regime.",

He reportedly attempted to downplay the severity of the outbreak and dispel the notion that the high number of political figures infected suggests that Iran has no control over the situation. Mesri reportedly insisted that the number of lawmakers infected made sense because of \u201ctheir close contact with people\u201d and the fact that they work in close quarters in Tehran.",

Ahmad Amirabadi Farhani, a Qom lawmaker now confirmed to have the disease after exhibiting symptoms last week, was the first to vocally condemn the regime, claiming that Khamenei was hiding dozens of deaths and that his city was in dire condition.",

In severe cases, which have tended to occur in older patients or those weakened by other conditions, the disease escalates into pneumonia, sometimes causing death. According to President Hassan Rouhani, Iran is testing individuals suspected of having the virus with homemade testing kits, not the standard kits approved by the World Health Organization, also leading to concerns government statistics are incorrect.",

However, beseeching God, seeking intercession from the Prophet and\u00a0his Household, and\u00a0the prayers of the pure youth and pious are very effective in repelling major tragedies,\u201d Khamenei said.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s unimportant, but let\u2019s not exaggerate it either. The Coronavirus will affect the country briefly & leave.

            "Interest in TCM has surged in recent years among alternative health practitioners, with sales of TCM methods such as acupuncture and Tai Chi bringing in around\u00a0$50 billion in annual revenue to China\u2019s economy. Amid the interest,\u00a0Chinese health authorities recently encouraged TCM practitioners to help find a cure for the coronavirus\u00a0outbreak, with initials findings allegedly yielding \u201coptimistic results.\u201d",
            "China\u2019s National Health Commission on Wednesday included TCM in its latest diagnosis and treatment scheme, demanding \u201cgreater efforts of treatment integrating TCM and Western medicine\u201d to help contain the virus.",

            "The\u00a0Times\u00a0goes on to claim that TCM doctors and experts have argued that combining it with scientific medicine has proven the ability to shorten the treatment process. It states that, while TCM has been found to have \u201csignificant effects\u201d in mild and moderate cases of the coronavirus, Western medicine continues to lag behind.",
            "It specifically cites the \u201crenowned Chinese respiratory expert\u201d Zhong Nanshan, who told a\u00a0press conference in Guangdong on Tuesday that he believes in the \u201cpositive effectiveness of TCM in treating patients in their early and middle stages, including killing the virus, reducing opportunities of the virus entering bodies and decreasing the occurrences of Cytokine storm.\u201d",
            "The\u00a0Times\u00a0also quotes the\u00a0deputy director of the Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine,\u00a0Lei Genping, who despite noting that TCM fails to provide\u00a0scientific explanations of its working mechanisms insists that he does solve a range of medical issues.",

We believe the patients lack yang, so we added bupleurum root and cassia twig into their prescriptions.\u201d",
            "The article does eventually admit that many qualified doctors and scientists have expressed serious doubts over the validity of TCM given that it has barely any scientific backing. Two\u00a0molecular genetics studies published in 2012 showed how many of the treatments can be harmful, with many unlisted ingredients known to cause cancer.",
            "\u201cSome Chinese herbal products have been contaminated with toxic compounds, heavy metals, pesticides, and microorganisms and may have serious side effects,\u201d notes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in its analysis of the medicine. \u201cManufacturing errors, in which one herb is mistakenly replaced with another, also have resulted in serious\u00a0complications.\u201d",
            "Last year, the World Health Organization (WHO), the most important global body trying to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus, accepted TCM as a legitimate form of treatment. The decision was criticized by scientists including the editors of the\u00a0Scientific American\u00a0magazine, who described it as an \u201cegregious lapse in evidence-based thinking and practice.\u201d",
            "\u201cData supporting the effectiveness of most traditional remedies are scant, at best,\u201d the magazine wrote in an editorial. \u201cAn extensive assessment was done in 2009 by researchers at the University of Maryland: they looked at 70 review papers evaluating TCM, including acupuncture. None of the studies proved conclusive because the data were either too paltry or did not meet testing standards.\u201d",

",
            "On Monday the state-run Global Times ran a weird editorial that asserted the entire world thinks better of Beijing for its deft handling of the outbreak and predicted history would not be kind to those who doubted the Communist Party.",
            "The backdrop for the Global Times editorial is the mounting political crisis facing the Communist Party after the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, a whistleblower who was treated as a seditious rumor-monger for sounding early alarms about the danger of the Wuhan coronavirus.",
            "Li died last week after contracting the virus and spending his last few weeks in the hospital. His passing galvanized public resentment of how the virus outbreak has been handled. It also proved challenging to claims that the virus is only deadly to elderly people or patients with serious existing medical conditions, as Li was only 34 and in seemingly good health.",
            "The Global Times editorial created an alternate reality filled with patriotic applause for the Communist Party and Chinese people coming together in a moment of crisis, contrary to \u201ctwo malicious points of view\u201d promoted by Western countries:",
            "One is naming the novel coronavirus the \u201cChina virus\u201d or \u201cWuhan virus.\u201d At the end of January, a newspaper in Denmark published a cartoon of the Chinese national flag that replaced the five symbolic stars with virus-like figures. Facing China\u2019s protest, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen responded that \u201cwe have freedom of expression in Denmark \u2013 also to draw.\u201d",
            "Such a position can be seen in other European countries as well. A German magazine insulted China by claiming the novel coronavirus is \u201cmade in China.\u201d And a host of a local radio program in the Netherlands danced while singing the virus was created by \u201cdirty Chinese people\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want to get infected, please stay away from Chinese food.\u201d",
            "The other malicious attack was calling China \u201csick man.\u201d On February 3, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece titled \u201cChina Is the Real Sick Man of Asia.\u201d The column was filled with ill-disguised arrogance and a sense of superiority that comes out of nowhere. The sinister intention of the newspaper and the author was to humiliate China.\u00a0",
            "I have read the author\u2019s book on the history of US diplomacy, an outstanding and broad-view work. But now, he took the epidemic as an opportunity to attack China as \u201ca sick man,\u201d I was surprised how could his understanding of China be so unexpectedly narrow?\u00a0",
            "The Chinese people, who are becoming increasingly more confident, don\u2019t get offended or outraged as easily as they used to. Now, the Chinese people tend to find those authors ridiculous, ignorant and hypocritical. They do not understand China or the world, nor do they have the empathy and passion that people are supposed to have.\u00a0",

            "China\u2019s initial response to the crisis was less than impressive. The Wuhan government was secretive and self-serving; national authorities responded vigorously but, it currently appears, ineffectively. China\u2019s cities and factories are shutting down; the virus continues to spread. We can hope that authorities succeed in containing the epidemic and treating its victims, but the performance to date has shaken confidence in the Chinese Communist Party at home and abroad. Complaints in Beijing about the U.S. refusing entry to noncitizens who recently spent time in China cannot hide the reality that the decisions that allowed the epidemic to spread as far and as fast as it did were all made in Wuhan and Beijing.",
            "The passage in Mead\u2019s essay that probably triggered Beijing hardest was his concern that China\u2019s economy, which is much more fragile than the Communist Party wants to admit, could be pushed into a tailspin by the epidemic:",
            "China\u2019s financial markets are probably more dangerous in the long run than China\u2019s wildlife markets. Given the accumulated costs of decades of state-driven lending, massive malfeasance by local officials in cahoots with local banks, a towering property bubble, and vast industrial overcapacity, China is as ripe as a country can be for a massive economic correction. Even a small initial shock could lead to a massive bonfire of the vanities as all the false values, inflated expectations and misallocated assets implode. If that comes, it is far from clear that China\u2019s regulators and decision makers have the technical skills or the political authority to minimize the damage\u2014especially since that would involve enormous losses to the wealth of the politically connected.",
            "The Global Times predicted history would not record criticism like Mead\u2019s in a \u201cpositive way.\u201d",
            "\u201cTheir voices will smell like stinky farts, making people frown and walk away. Perhaps some impartial historians will tell later generations how the epidemic in China mirrors the greatness of many people and the paltry sense of compassion a handful of others have demonstrated disgracefully,\u201d the editorial hissed, bringing in other persistent China critics such as Gordon Chang and David Shambaugh as examples of supposedly ostracized writers who have become \u201cunpopular and despised\u201d for selling China short.",
            "The editorial concluded by predicting how future historians would write about the year 2020:",
            "The Chinese underwent a tough time over the year. They had to battle the novel coronavirus epidemic at home, and deal with insulting attacks from some foreigners. Yet they are strong and they stay strong. This great country has weathered the year of 2020, like any year over its history of 5,000 years, and they have achieved their goal of making their lives better.",

The New York Post described two such doctors on Monday, noting that both were told to stop spreading \u201crumors,\u201d and one was made to sign a statement of submission to authority similar to the one forced on Li in December."

            "\u201cPresident Trump really took a leadership position on this. So, several weeks ago when he stopped flights coming or individuals coming from China that had a nexus to China, as well as funneling a number of flights into 11\u00a0airports. We were the first country to do that,\u201d Wolf said when asked to describe U.S. efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus. \u201cWe were out in front of everyone else and a variety of other countries have now followed suit. The president and the administration got criticized for doing that too soon, too fast, and I think in hindsight it was absolutely the right move. Now we have some of those same critics saying we\u2019re not doing enough, so I think it\u2019s very interesting. We continue to lean forward at the department. Our primary role at the department on this is making sure that we keep sick individuals out of this country. So we do that at airports of entry, land ports of entry, that\u2019s our Canadian border and also our southwest border, we also have coastguard monitoring a number of ships that have a nexus to China, mainly cargo ships. But every ship has passengers and crew aboard, so we are taking an all variety look at this.\u201d",
            "When asked to detail the review and screening process for people entering the United States, Wolf explained how travelers will encounter Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and if needed then face Center for Disease Control (CDC) officials as well for examination.",
            "\u201cSo, individuals coming off flights will first come in contact with a CBP officer, which is a normal immigration officer,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cFrom there, they will go to contract medical personnel that DHS has stood up at these 11 airports. They\u2019re going to take a variety of information from you, they\u2019re going to ask you a number of questions. How long have you been in China? Where have you visited? They\u2019re also going to take temperature checks and other visual medical checks and if they determine they don\u2019t like what they see or you need additional medical checks, we\u2019re going refer you to CDC officials at those 11\u00a0airports that will go further into your medical history to get further checks. \u2026 For those individuals that are not symptomatic, we are directing them to self-quarantine so they will continue on to their home. They\u2019ll self-quarantine for 14 days, again we are tracking all of these individuals, so we are making sure we turn over their data and information to local and state health officials so those officials in those jurisdictions can also track those individuals. So, it\u2019s a pretty comprehensive program we are putting in place, making sure those individuals that have visited or have an excess to China in the last 14 days are being medically screened and we know where they are.\u201d",
            "Wolf\u2019s interview came Saturday afternoon at CPAC hosted by the American Conservative Union, and aired Tuesday morning on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 on Breitbart News Daily. He also covered several successes of the Trump administration on combatting illegal immigration and terrorism. This part of the interview, on the Trump administration\u2019s fight with coronavirus, is the first of multiple pieces on this front.",

Can I keep it?\u2019 I think that\u2019s all it takes for a landslide. So I think that solid \u2014 I\u2019ll just put a number on it \u2014 25 percent of Democrats would realize that it\u2019s not their best interest [to vote for Bernie Sanders].\u201d",

            "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to change a system that\u2019s working,\u201d Adam said. \u201cNow, if you were to subtract coronavirus, you would see a system that is working better than the economy\u2019s ever worked. It\u2019s the best economy of all time, and it\u2019s irrational to change things when they\u2019re working that well, even if they\u2019re not perfect. So you don\u2019t tear it down and start from scratch in that situation, and you can depend on a solid 25 percent of Democrats saying, \u2018You know, it just doesn\u2019t make sense, the size and the risk for the reward that\u2019s in front of us.'\u201d",

            "\u201cBiden\u2019s problem \u2014 of course, it\u2019s obvious \u2014 is his declining mental state,\u201d Adams stated. \u201cThe thing I predicted is that we\u2019d have a Joe Biden \u2026 get the nomination and that he picks \u2014 to bolster his campaign \u2014 somebody younger, ideally female, [a] person of color, and Kamala [Harris] kind of stands out as the obvious one there, but wouldn\u2019t that make her \u2014 at least in the, in the eyes of the voters, if not in reality \u2014 sort of a shadow president?\u201d",

Kamala Harris (D-CA) as a running mate would make the California senator appear to be \u201csomebody who\u2019s the power behind the throne and whoever people think is backing Harris, whichever Democrats or billionaires or donors,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s going to look like they\u2019re in charge just because Biden\u2019s going to look like a weak candidate mentally.\u201d",

            "Adams concluded, \u201cI think you\u2019ll fairly rapidly see that we\u2019ll get some kind of a control on it, which doesn\u2019t mean we stop the virus.

            "The\u00a0Epoch Times, a Chinese-American anti-communist newspaper, sent journalists to speak with the heads of several funeral homes and crematoriums in Hubei province \u2013 whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicenter of the current novel coronavirus outbreak. The newspaper found that adding up the total number of people cremated per day in several funeral homes yielded a significantly larger number than the official number of deaths tallied since the outbreak began in December.",
            "The Chinese Communist Party alerted the world to the discovery of a new type of coronavirus on January 20, over a month after locals became aware of a disease spreading and 20 days after local officials shut down a wild meat market in Wuhan where the virus is believed to have originated.",
            "According to the\u00a0Epoch Times, the crematoria were handling \u201c4-5 times the usual cremation volume\u201d per day. Few of those cremated were officially confirmed as coronavirus cases.",
            "\u201cI received 127 corpses yesterday [February 3], and burned 116. Among them, 8 were confirmed [coronavirus cases] on the death certificate and 48 were suspected,\u201d a funeral home director in Hubei using the pseudonym \u201cYou Hu\u201d told the newspaper. \u201cI am about to collapse, we are under great pressure now.\u201d",
            "The newspaper offered insight into a larger funeral home in Hankou, a Wuhan neighborhood, which it estimated had the capacity to burn 576 people per day. \u201cYou Hu\u201d told the\u00a0Epoch Times that the backlog of people waiting to be cremated was not due to lack of space in the burners, but lack of sufficient transportation and collapsing staff numbers, as few were sleeping or taking breaks. Due to transportation and staff limits, the\u00a0Epoch Times estimated that the Hankou crematorium was burning 225 corpses a day.",
            "With this math, the newspaper concludes that Hubei province incinerated 341 bodies on February 3; China reported 65 deaths nationwide due to coronavirus that day.",
            "The article went on to state that Hubei province has eight municipal funeral homes. Similarly judging from their capacity for bodies and the amount of time the furnaces are running, the article adds another 135 patients a day to the tally from five of these. The other three, it concludes, burned 476 people a day. While less confident in these numbers since the journalists were unable to speak to their managers, these numbers reveal a rough estimate of nearly 1,000 people incinerated per day.",
            "Of course, the article notes that there is no guarantee that all these people died after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus. It notes that, of the 127 remains \u201cYou Hu\u201d received on February 3 (116 were cremated that day), eight were confirmed coronavirus patients and 48 were suspected carriers. The newspaper also identified another funeral home that took in 22 sets of remains and three were confirmed coronavirus cases.",
            "These numbers, the report argues, do not align with the Communist Party policies issued on handling coronavirus remains.",
            "\u201cAs per from the current policy of the Communist Party of China \u2026 the funeral home must give priority to the burning of novel coronavirus patients\u2019 bodies; other bodies may not be burned on the same day due to funeral culture, rituals, and other reasons,\u201d the article notes. \u201cBased on this, it can be inferred that the 116 dead [at \u201cYou Hu\u201d\u2018s crematorium] basically all died of novel coronavirus pneumonia, or at least suspected of having died of it.\u201d",
            "What\u2019s more, a local ordinance in at least one Hubei county, Yangxin, required crematoria to immediately handle coronavirus victims and prioritize them over other deaths.",
            "The\u00a0Epoch Times report is not the first one to accuse the Chinese regime of secretly cremating large numbers of individuals suspected of carrying the novel coronavirus \u2013 or refusing to take patients in hospitals and confirm their disease. Last week, the Hong Kong-based website Initium Media published a report contending that the Communist Party is artificially suppressing the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak by incinerating people suspected of having died of it before their deaths can be properly documented.",
            "The implication that China is also not properly documenting cause of death on people\u2019s birth certificates is also not new. Shortly after China revealed the outbreak to the world on January 20, Radio Free Asia (RFA) highlighted the strange death of Xu Dapeng, the founder of the oldest environmentalist group in the country. Xu and his wife lived in Wuhan and both died of pneumonia in January. Neither they nor anyone who was exposed to them were tested for the novel coronavirus, and their cause of death was simply declared \u201cpneumonia.\u201d",
            "At press time Friday, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed 31,527 cases of novel coronavirus. Of those, 638 people have died, all but two within China. The government also claimed another 1,568 people have fully recovered from the infection.",

Luckily, they\u2019re not doing that with the coronavirus, right now. They are choosing what goes into their media, as they do, but it does seem that they\u2019re being more forthcoming with information, and now that the World Health Organization has declared an emergency, they are going to have to be even more forthcoming in the future to make sure that it does get under control.\u201d",

            "According to the Associated Press, a spokesman for the Health Ministry confirmed on Tuesday the report that Harirchi was a confirmed coronavirus case. Harirchi had appeared in a press conference on Monday appearing somewhat sickly and reportedly uploaded a video in Farsi confirming that he had coronavirus to social media before the Iranian government officially confirmed it.",

Coronavirus symptoms can vary from severe pneumonia and death to no symptoms at all, so it is possible that Harirchi feels healthy enough to continue working.",
            "At Harirchi\u2019s last public appearance, he denied allegations by Iranian Parliament member\u00a0Ahmad Amirabadi Farhani that the Islamic regime is hiding the true number of coronavirus cases in the country. The lawmaker \u2013 from the city of Qom, where the virus first started spreading \u2013 accused the Iranian Health Ministry of not moving fast enough to contain cases of coronavirus or treat infected patients. He also claimed that hundreds of people are being screened as potential patients.",

            "Reports from Iran indicated that Amirabadi also appeared ill in his last public appearance and officials in Parliament ordered him to return to Qom and isolate himself, as he could have potentially also been carrying coronavirus.",

            "While Amirabadi suggests hundreds of Coronavirus cases in the country, the Health Ministry announced only 95 confirmed cases nationwide and 15 deaths since the first cases in Qom were identified publicly last week. Health Ministry spokesman\u00a0Kianoush Jahanpour asserted that Tehran was prepared to combat the virus with 700,000 sanitation packs including disinfectant and sanitation masks.",

Iran\u2019s military \u2013 and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization \u2013 have begun attempting to wrestle control of coronavirus response out of the hands of the Health Ministry. IRGC Commander Hossein Salami asserted Monday that his terrorist network is ready to take action against the virus, in addition to the Defense Ministry\u2019s declaration of developing new technology. The Foreign Ministry also announced several planned border closures to protect countries that have still not documented any cases.",

Eight infected people are known to have entered Taiwan, and 27 of the people they came in contact with have displayed symptoms. One indigenous case of transmission\u00a0 \u2013 i.e. someone who caught the virus after being exposed while in Taiwan \u2013 has been confirmed.",

            "Popovich accused Trump of being a \u201ccoward\u201d because of his Coronavirus policies.",
            "\u201cIt was our president blaming Barack Obama for the fact we don\u2019t have the kits we need right now. Seriously, I think he thinks Barack Obama tripped [1984 U.S. Olympian and 3,000-meter runner] Mary Decker,\u201d Popovich said according to the New York Post.",
            "\u201cSeriously, so you know if it affects him personally in a financial or political way and it\u2019s positive, he\u2019ll tout about it, and he\u2019ll brag about it forever. But if it goes against him whether it\u2019s a person or an organization, he\u2019ll go after it. We all know why: Because he\u2019s a coward,\u201d Popovich added.",
            "Of course, according to PJ Media, Obama waited to declare the H1N1 virus a public health emergency until 1,000 Americans had already died. Meanwhile, with today\u2019s Coronavirus, a far smaller number of Americans have died, 21, and Trump has already moved to deal with the outbreak.",
            "Indeed, the wild reactions to Coronavirus is out of proportion to its lethality. After all, according to the CDC about 10,000 to 12,000 people die every year from the average, every-day flu. So, the Coronavirus, at this stage, is by far a lesser health problem. Still, Popovich seems on the side of fanning flames over the virus.",
            "But while the NBA coach, whose team is in a dismal 12th place among the 15 Western Conference teams, is forever on the lookout for things to with which to attack Trump, Popovich was more willing to give China a pass despite being one of the most oppressive nations on earth.",
            "Popovich, who calls Trump a \u201ccoward,\u201d found himself unable to criticize China for its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong or its long record of human rights abuses.",
            "According to a report at Human Rights Watch, China is still one of the worst abusers of human rights in the world. In its 2018 report, the organization reported that China has \u201cdramatically stepped up repression and systematic abuses against the 13 million Turkic Muslims, including Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs, in China\u2019s northwestern Xinjiang region.\u201d",
            "Yet last year, when the NBA was in the midst of its controversial kowtowing to China, Popovich was unable to voice any fault at all with the communist nation.",

            "Fox News anchor Chris Wallace argued Friday on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d that President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus press conference \u201cclearly didn\u2019t\u201d ease concerns.",
            "He cited the drop in the stock market as proof.",
            "Wallace said, \u201cThe idea that HHS workers were sent to deal with people who had been evacuated from China who were in quarantine and they didn\u2019t have the proper\u00a0equipment or training\u00a0and then as Jonathan Hunt\u00a0suggested made things even\u00a0worse because they then left\u00a0the quarantined area and went\u00a0into the general public. That is the real key. Obviously, there is a lot of\u00a0legitimate concerns here on the\u00a0part of the American people. There is also some panic going\u00a0on that seems like unfounded\u00a0concerns. But the administration has got\u00a0to give a sense that they\u2019re on\u00a0top of this and ahead of it and\u00a0flooding the zone that they\u2019re\u00a0doing everything possible. When you get a story like this\u00a0that HHS wasn\u2019t even protecting\u00a0its own workers allegedly. We\u2019ll see whether or not it\u2019s\u00a0true.\u00a0it gives a sense they\u2019re\u00a0playing catch-up.\u201d",
            "He continued, \u201cOne of the questions here is public confidence, and clearly the president wanted to hold that press conference on Wednesday with the array of health officials from CDC and HHS and the whole government alphabet, if you will, of agencies to ease people\u2019s concerns. Clearly, it didn\u2019t do that, because the next day the markets fell, what, 1200 points, the biggest single-day drop in the history of the Dow Jones. Today it\u2019s down what, another 973, you know we\u2019re going to be down several thousand points this week. So it hasn\u2019t eased people\u2019s concerns. Again, part of it is panic and part of it is also a concern, I think, that early on you did see this kind of mixed messaging where the president seemed to be more optimistic about how the U.S. was handling the coronavirus, the fact that it was going to be over soon, that was going to end once the weather got warmer, and somewhat more serious warnings from some of the health officials.\u201d",
            "He added, \u201cThat is really the key, I think, nobody can wave a magic wand and make it go away, but people have to have a sense that the administration is doing all that can in the public health sense, and that politics is not a factor, cause it shouldn\u2019t be a factor either on the part of Republicans or Democrats.\u201d",

            "Chen\u2019s family says he has been forcibly quarantined in order to silence him after he posted viral video reports that challenged the official narrative about the situation in Wuhan.",
            "Chen, a human rights activist who at 34 happens to be the same age as the late Dr. Li Wenliang, has been reporting from Wuhan since the city was placed under lockdown on January 24.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve said before that I\u2019m a citizen journalist. What kind of journalist am I if I don\u2019t rush to the front line when there is a disaster?\u201d he said in his first dispatch from Wuhan. Another early video denounced the government for abusing\u00a0Wenliang and seven other whistleblowers who tried to give an early warning of how dangerous the virus was.",
            "His video reports depicted a medical system overwhelmed by the virus to a much higher degree than the Chinese government, at any level, wanted to admit. January 24 was only four days after the Chinese began admitting the virus can be spread by human contact.",
            "Chen vowed that he would keep reporting from Wuhan until the epidemic was over. He promised not to spread wild rumors or deliberate incite panic, but was determined to expose the government cover-up of how severe the virus outbreak is, and how badly it was being handled by local and national officials.",
            "\u201cI am afraid. In front of me is disease. Behind me is China\u2019s legal and administrative power. But as long as I am alive I will speak about what I have seen and what I have heard. I am not afraid of dying. Why should I be afraid of you, Communist Party?\u201d he said in a January 30 report.",
            "Chen\u2019s reports included interviews with Wuhan medical personnel who said many virus deaths had been concealed, supplies were short, and government censorship was hindering efforts to spread important safety information about the disease. He decried the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia in Hubei province that made it difficult for residents to work together to distribute supplies and keep the virus from spreading. Several of his visits to hospitals and clinics revealed there were not enough beds for sick patients and not enough test kits for people who thought they might have contracted the coronavirus.",
            "The Hong Kong Free Press detailed the last few reports Chen was able to upload before he went dark:",
            "The first one showed large crowds outside of a pharmacy attempting to buy a Chinese medicine called \u201cshuanghuanglian.\u201d On January 31, The Chinese Academy of Sciences released a report in The People Daily News claiming that the medicine could repress viral replication. While the medical experts admitted that there wasn\u2019t any clinical evidence about the effectiveness of the medicine, panicked shoppers bought up all the medicine from the market.",
            "The second one showed national security officers disguised as disease control officers visiting Wuhan citizen reporter Fang Bin late at night claiming that they suspected he was infected. On January 31, Fang Bin uploaded a video taken from Wuhan No.5 hospital which showed how corpses from the hospital were sent to a funeral house and he believed that was the real reason for his arrest.",
            "Fang was released the following day and talked about the incident via Chen\u2019s YouTube channel. The police had accused him of creating social panic.",
            "Both Fang and Chen were trying to dig into the stories about the death toll of the Wuhan coronavirus. Chen visited the Hanhou Funeral Home on January 29 and found out that within a period of 1.5 hours four vehicles had entered the funeral home, a designated cremation center for bodies infected with the coronavirus. On January 31, Fang Bin found out that a vehicle parked at the entrance of the No.5 hospital was loaded with 8 bodies.",
            "According to friends and family quoted by CNN on Sunday, Chen suffered the same fate as Fang Bin. On Thursday, he went completely dark on social media and stopped returning phone calls. He was banned on Chinese social media over the summer for filing forbidden reports about the Hong Kong protests, but he filed his Wuhan reports using YouTube and Twitter, two platforms blocked by the Chinese Communist Party.",
            "Chen\u2019s mother appealed for public help to find her son on Friday, then later relayed a message through one of Chen\u2019s friends that said she was told by state security officers that Chen had been detained for quarantine. The officers refused to tell her where he was quarantined.",
            "CNN said both city and provincial police officials claimed to have no information about his whereabouts. People who had recent contact with Chen said he displayed no signs of illness. His friend Xu XiaoDong posted a video that claimed Chen was taken by force and his cellphone was confiscated, while patients quarantined for the virus are normally allowed to keep their phones.",
            "The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Chen knew he would probably be arrested for his reporting, so he \u201cgave select friends access to his accounts, instructing them to change the passwords if they went more than 12 hours without hearing from him.\u201d",
            "The Post theorized Chen was silenced in a bid to control spiraling public fury over the death of Wenliang. That bid may have backfired, as CNN noted Chen has become far better known to the Chinese public as news of his disappearance spread. The Chinese Internet is reportedly flooding with posts angry about Chen\u2019s disappearance and demanding to know his whereabouts.",
            "\u201cWho is Chen Qiushi? Why are there so many people looking for him? Why does the media censor his name?\u201d asked one prominent user on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter.\u00a0",
            "\u201cHe is a lawyer. He is a journalist. He is someone who dares to go to Wuhan to report the truest conditions when the outbreak is at its most severe stage. He is a hero. And he has gone missing,\u201d read a reply to that message quoted by CNN."

            "Lam\u2019s critics also remain deeply concerned that her administration will not completely seal the border with China, so it is trying to get the public accustomed to wearing masks and tolerating quarantine facilities in crowded areas as infected people trickle in from China.",

            "Ironically, the protests were relatively small compared to the past eight months of demonstrations in Hong Kong because so many people are sequestered in their homes to avoid exposure to the virus. They were still large enough to create significant disruptions in Hong Kong rail and road service. Some protesters physically blocked railroad tracks with their bodies or threw debris onto the tracks to slow down trains.",

            "The Wuhan virus is not as deadly as SARS, but it appears to be far more contagious. With at least 6,000 known infections in over a dozen countries tallied up on Wednesday, the Wuhan virus has already infected almost as many people in two months as SARS did during its entire run.

            "The expert in question, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, explained his estimates are much higher than the official figures because the virus can be carried for a considerable period of time before symptoms become apparent, and too many people were allowed to travel out of Wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak when the Chinese Communist Party was still insisting the disease could not be spread by human contact.",
            "\u201cSooner or later we will get a case,\u201d Ferguson said this week of the outlook for the United Kingdom. \u201cThere are very large numbers of Chinese tourists across Europe right now. Unless the Chinese manage to control this, and I\u2019m skeptical about whether that is possible, we will get cases here.\u201d",

            "The mystery behind the origin of the Chinese coronavirus \u2013 first identified in the central metropolis of Wuhan, home to one of China\u2019s most advanced biological laboratories \u2013 has birthed many theories on how the highly contagious outbreak began. Chinese authorities initially concluded that the virus originated in wild animal meat and jumped to humans at a wild meat market in Wuhan, but multiple scientific studies have dismissed that possibility, leaving no widely agreed-upon explanation.",
            "Chinese officials themselves have speculated that the virus originated outside of the country, despite no evidence of it having infected a human being outside of Wuhan before December 2019.",

In severe cases, patients experience difficulty breathing that evolves into pneumonia, sometimes with fatal consequences. Most fatal cases appear to be occurring among seniors or individuals with other chronic conditions.",

            "Rogoff proposed some possible government measures to address the coronavirus threat: \u201cCertainly having people get free tests, for example, if they want to, or possibly finding ways to make it easier to call in sick might be a short-term solution [and among the] kinds of things to government can spend money on.\u201d",
            "Government policy, Rogoff said, must also seek to \u201cstem the panic,\u201d but should aim beyond financial concerns alone. \u201c[T]he panic is not just about [if] their money [is] in the bank. The panic is much more about people\u2019s health.\u201d",
            "Rogoff predicted: \u201cWe\u2019re going to end up doing stimulus policies out of this, even in the United States, even with the civil war going on in the political sphere. They\u2019re going to do some kind of significant fiscal stimulus this year to try to mitigate the coronavirus. Call me an optimist, but I\u2019m expecting that.\u201d",

            "Pound, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, did not sound alarmist. But he did speak frankly about the risks facing the Olympics, which open July 24.",
            "Pound has been an International Olympic Committee member since 1978, 13 years longer than current President Thomas Bach.",
            "\u201cYou could certainly go to two months out if you had to,\u201d Pound said, which would mean putting off a decision until late May and hoping the virus is under control. \u201cA lot of things have to start happening. You\u2019ve got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic Village, the hotels, The media folks will be in there building their studios.\u201d",
            "And if it got to the point of not going ahead, Pound speculated \u201cyou\u2019re probably looking at a cancellation.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis is the new war and you have to face it. In and around that time, I\u2019d say folks are going to have to ask: \u2018Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo, or not?\u2019\u201d",
            "China on Tuesday reported 508 new cases and another 71 deaths, 68 of them in the central city of Wuhan, where the epidemic was first detected in December. The updates bring mainland China\u2019s totals to 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths. South Korea now has the second-most cases in the world with 977, including 10 deaths. Clusters of the illness are now appearing in the Middle East and Europe. This could signal a new stage in the spread of the virus with four deaths reported in Japan.",
            "Pound encouraged athletes to keep training. About 11,000 are expected for the Olympics, and another 4,400 for the Paralympics, which open on Aug. 25.",
            "\u201cAs far as we all know you\u2019re going to be in Tokyo,\u201d Pound said. \u201cAll indications are at this stage that it will be business as usual. So keep focused on your sport and be sure that the IOC is not going to send you into a pandemic situation.\u201d",
            "The modern Olympics dating from 1896 have only been cancelled during wartime, and faced boycotts in 1976 in Montreal, in 1980 in Moscow and 1984 in Los Angeles \u2014 all in Pound\u2019s memory.",
            "The Olympics in 1940 were to be in Tokyo, but were called off because of Japan\u2019s war with China and World War II.",
            "Pound called uncertainty a major problem and repeated the IOC\u2019s stance \u2014 that it\u2019s depending on consultations with the World Health Organization, a United Nations body, to make any move. So far, the games are on.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a big, big, big decision and you just can\u2019t take it until you have reliable facts on which to base it,\u201d Pound said. He said whatever advice the IOC is now getting, \u201cit doesn\u2019t call for cancellation or postponement of the Olympics. You just don\u2019t postpone something on the size and scale of the Olympics. There\u2019s so many moving parts, so many countries and different seasons, and competitive seasons, and television seasons. You can\u2019t just say, we\u2019ll do it in October.\u201d",
            "If changes have to be made, Pound said every option faced obstacles.",
            "Pound said moving to another city seemed unlikely.",
            "\u201cTo move the place is difficult because there are few places in the world that could think of gearing up facilities in that short time to put something on,\u201d Pound said.",
            "London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey has suggested the British capital as an alternative. Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike suggested that was an inappropriate offer, using the virus as political campaign fodder.",
            "Pound said he would not favor a dispersal of events over various venues because that wouldn\u2019t \u201cconstitute an Olympic Games. You\u2019d end up with a series of world championships.\u201d He said it would be very difficult to spread around all these sports in a 17-day period with only a few month\u2019s notice.",
            "Staying in Tokyo but moving it back a few months would be unlikely to satisfy North American broadcasters, whose schedules are full in the fall with American football, college football, European soccer, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey. Of course, other world broadcasters also have jammed schedules.",
            "\u201cIt would be tough to get the kind of blanket coverage that people expect around the Olympic Games,\u201d Pound said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly tougher than it would have been in 1964 in Tokyo when you didn\u2019t have the saturation sports schedule on television.\u201d",
            "How about delaying for a year, but staying in Tokyo? Japan is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics, although a national audit board says the country is spending twice that much.",
            "\u201cThen you have to ask if you can hold the bubble together for an extra year,\u201d Pound said. \u201cThen of course you have to fit all of this into the entire international sports schedule.\u201d",
            "Pound said the IOC has been building up an \u201cemergency fund\u201d for such circumstances, reported to be about $1 billion. That could fund international sports federations who depend on income from the IOC to operate \u2014 and the IOC itself.",
            "\u201cThis would be what you normally call a force majeure,\u201d said Pound, a Canadian lawyer by training, using the legal phrase for \u201cunforeseeable circumstances.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not an insurable risk and it\u2019s not one that can be attributed to one or the other of the parties. So everybody takes their lumps. There would be a lack of revenue on the Olympic Movement side.\u201d",
            "He said broadcasters may have their own insurance that would \u201cmitigate some of the losses.\u201d",
            "About 73% of the IOC\u2019s $5.7 billion income in a four-year Olympic cycle is from broadcast rights.",
            "Pound said the future of the Tokyo Games was largely out of the IOC\u2019s hands, depending on the virus and if it abets.",
            "\u201cIf it gets to be something like the Spanish Flu,\u201d Pound said, referring to a deadly pandemic early in the 20th century that killed millions. \u201cAt that level of lethality, then everybody\u2019s got to take their medicine.\u201d"

            "The Wuhan coronavirus, as it was more commonly referred to before the World Health Organization (WHO) debuted the official names for the virus and disease, originated in China and has infected over 80,000 people worldwide since Beijing made the outbreak public in January. Chinese Communist Party officials have repeatedly complained that any focus on limiting contact with people exposed to the virus in Wuhan is \u201cracist\u201d and have consistently pressured the WHO to conform to China\u2019s political agenda.",
            "In the most blatant case of bullying the WHO, the Chinese government has forced the organization to ban the government of Taiwan from participating in coronavirus response, claiming that Taiwan is not a sovereign state. The WHO insists that it trusts Beijing to offer aid and relevant information to Taipei, making direct contact unnecessary. The WHO has not clarified why it believes that China will act in good faith towards Taiwan after repeatedly threatening to invade it and have the \u201cbones ground to powder\u201d of anyone who acknowledges the reality of Taiwanese independence.",
            "The WHO claimed it was necessary to give the Wuhan coronavirus a name not associated with any particular place to avoid \u201cstigma.\u201d",
            "On Monday, Health Ministry disease control official Achmad Yurianto addressed the case of a Japanese citizen who arrived in his native country and tested positive for the virus after visiting Indonesia. The man, who has only been identified as a male in his 60s, reportedly visited a health facility in Japan before visiting Indonesia with mild cold symptoms and was not found to be a viral carrier. After returning from a trip to Indonesia a few days later, the man was reportedly hospitalized with a severe respiratory infection. The case has called into question Indonesia\u2019s screening measures for the disease, as it appears no one stopped the man from traveling back and forth.",
            "Yurianto attempted to calm the nation on Monday by insisting that the man was\u00a0\u201cnot a case of COVID-19,\u201d but of \u201cSARS-CoV-2,\u201d the virus that causes COVID-19. While this is technically possible \u2013 an asymptomatic patient would have SARS-CoV-2 but not COVID-19 \u2013 Yurianto also argued falsely that the two terms referred to different viral DNA structures.",
            "\u201cWhat we have now is a COVID-19 epidemic. There are experts saying that COVID-19 is different from SARS CoV-2, and that the differences reach\u00a070 percent,\u201d he said in remarks prior to rejecting the notion that the Japanese man had \u201cCOVID-19.\u201d",
            "The confusion has raised alarm, as it suggested that government health officials may be confused by the terminology and thus incorrectly categorizing cases. Officials around the world have yet to identify other similar mistakes in counting viral carriers as confirmed cases of the virus, or not doing so, based on the presence of symptoms, but reports from whistleblowers inside both China and Iran have indicated that authoritarian governments are manipulating the number of confirmed cases of each to make the outbreaks appear minimal.",
            "In China, locals in Wuhan anonymously reported that, in the early days of the outbreak, hospitals actively rejected patients showing clear symptoms of infection for testing, some of whom died without being tested for the virus at all. Other reports suggested that some potential coronavirus cases were branded \u201cpneumonia\u201d deaths without testing for the novel coronavirus.",
            "In Iran, a lawmaker from the nation\u2019s most affected city, Qom, accused Tehran of reporting fake virus numbers to the WHO to hide dozens of deaths caused by it.",
            "There is no indication that Indonesian officials are similarly trying to hide coronavirus cases. Instead, the Yuriarto case indicates that pressure from China to brand the new virus with a name that does not clearly identify it as the same virus that originated in Wuhan has resulted in a baffling identification system for some in global governments.",
            "In February, the WHO announced they would name the virus SARS-CoV-2, to identify it as a close relative of the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. The infection caused by the virus would be named COVID-19.",
            "\u201cWe had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, or an individual or group of people,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, arguing that not doing so would lead to \u201cstigma.\u201d",
            "It is common practice to name illnesses and viruses after locations or animals. The Ebola virus is named for the eponymous river in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another coronavirus, similarly received a name tied to its origins. The Zika virus is named for Uganda\u2019s Ziika forest.\u00a0The name norovirus, typically referencing a gastrointestinal infection, originated from Norwalk, Ohio, where it was first observed as a separate virus.",
            "Yet in 2015, the WHO announced it would move away from \u201cstigmatizing\u201d names. The move was received with concern at the time:",

            "\u201cYou should not take political correctness so far that in the end no one is able to distinguish these diseases,\u201d says Christian Drosten, a virologist at the University of Bonn, Germany.",
            "In naming the Wuhan virus, the WHO admits that it not only wanted to avoid associating the virus with China, but it wanted to avoid associating the virus, which is genetically very similar to SARS, with SARS.",
            "\u201cFrom a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003,\u201d the WHO explains on its Wuhan virus webpage.

            "Tang, appointed head of the police force late last year in a response to widespread pro-democracy protests in the city, disparaged the comedy program\u00a0Headliner for, among other things, not condemning the protests. He also reportedly complained in his letter that the program helped create public misconceptions that police indeed are keeping necessary safety gear from the public.",
            "Hong Kong has logged 105 Chinese coronavirus cases as of Thursday and two deaths. The virus, originating in central Wuhan, China, has prompted waves of protests against the government for not shutting the border to Chinese people to limit the spread of the virus. Hong Kong authorities, controlled by Beijing, insisted it was necessary to maintain traffic flow with China, leading to a major health workers\u2019 strike, firebombings of coronavirus clinics, and ongoing civil disobedience.",
            "\u201cAs a public broadcaster, I believe that the programmes produced by your station should reflect the facts and let the general public understand what is happening in society, rather than mislead the audience,\u201d Tang\u2019s letter read in part, as reproduced by RTHK. \u201cHeadliner will cause viewers to have a wrong impression and misunderstanding of the police force. If the public loses confidence in the police force, criminals will have a chance to take advantage of it, and Hong Kong\u2019s law and order will be difficult to maintain. This is definitely of major public interest.\u201d",

Many protesters believe that the Hong Kong police force deliberately killed protesters \u2013 or at least put them in deadly positions, such as in the case of\u00a0Chow Tsz-lok\u00a0who fell to his death in a parking complex. Police never clarified the young man\u2019s death, but many protesters believe police chased him from a nearby protest into the parking garage where he accidentally fell from the third floor.",

            "In the aftermath of the airing of the coronavirus episode, pro-communist viewers bombarded Hong Kong\u2019s Communications Authority with complaints. A small number of people organized outside of RTHK headquarters demanding that \u201cheads must roll\u201d over the comedy sketch.",

Under Hong Kong law, broadcasters who did not pay for a broadcasting license are required to air blocks of RTHK programming \u201cin the public interest;\u201d the laws were passed before RTHK itself was a channel, merely producing content broadcast on others. That regulation changed Wednesday, seemingly as a response to the\u00a0Headliner controversy.",
            "\u201cAfter considering the free TV licensee\u2019s request and the views of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Communications Authority concurs that there is no justifiable case to continue to require commercial broadcasters to broadcast RTHK programmes,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cFurthermore, lifting the requirements enables free TV licensees to put the spectrum and airtime released to more efficient use. The timeslots vacated could be used to broadcast other programmes, thereby providing more diversified TV programme choices to the public.\u201d",

            "But the effort won\u2019t provide a quick fix for this particular virus because of the time required for the process to go from the research and development phase to healthcare providers and patients.",
            "The Motley Fool noted that while there are \u201chundreds of drugmakers and diagnosis companies\u201d announcing their work on the coronavirus, only three best represent this sector of the public health battle.\u00a0",
            "The first is Gilead Sciences, which is working on a potential antiviral treatment:",
            "In the U.S., a patient with worsening symptoms of a confirmed 2019-nCoV infection has been treated with an experimental antiviral from Gilead Sciences called remdesivir. Gilead\u2019s experimental antiviral appeared effective based on a throat swab that tested negative for the virus just a few days after receiving the infusion. It\u2019s important to understand that Gilead is developing remdesivir to combat the Ebola virus, not 2019-nCoV. Success from a single patient is great news, but there are still a lot of important ins and outs left to consider here. To produce some evidence of efficacy governments can use to make public health decisions, Gilead is working with Chinese authorities to begin a controlled, randomized study. No matter how hard they step on the gas, though, it will take months to produce the necessary data.",
            "The second is Moderna, which is working on a vaccine:",
            "While Gilead works on a potential treatment for 2019-nCoV, a much younger company is developing a vaccine to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in the first place.\u00a0Although Moderna doesn\u2019t have many accomplishments to date, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has agreed to fund the manufacturing of a 2019-nCoV vaccine that uses the company\u2019s proprietary messenger RNA (mRNA) platform. In a nutshell, Moderna\u2019s vaccine should instruct a healthy patient\u2019s cells to produce proteins that serve as wanted posters that help the immune system recognize infected cells. Moderna\u2019s potential 2019-nCoV vaccine presents an elegant solution to a difficult problem, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions.",
            "Roche is working on rapid screening diagnostics:",
            "Global pharmaceutical and diagnostics giant Roche has already developed a test that can tell whether or not someone has a 2019-nCoV infection within a couple of hours. Roche\u2019s coronavirus test hasn\u2019t been approved for marketing yet, but the need for screening is serious enough to take the risk. A relatively fast 2019-nCoV diagnostic will help prevent infected patients who aren\u2019t presenting obvious symptoms from spreading the virus to their healthy families and coworkers. Unfortunately, emergency border closures have made it hard to deliver all the equipment needed to use Roche\u2019s coronavirus assays.",
            "The Motley Fool noted in its report that Roche might add to the $63.8 billion it earned last year by selling some of its equipment to Chinese hospitals.",
            "As for Moderna\u2019s vaccine, \u201cit will be more than a year before we know if Moderna can produce a 2019-nCoV vaccine worth manufacturing,\u201d the Motley Fool reported.",
            "The fate of Gilead\u2019s antiviral is also still up in the air.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s a chance Gilead\u2019s antiviral could find a home as a treatment for 2019-nCoV because coronaviruses behave much differently than Ebola and the rest of the filovirus family,\u201d the article states. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best to wait for more evidence before getting too excited.\u201d",

Major social media platforms were ordered to clamp down on coronavirus posts and shut down numerous accounts for \u201cillegally reporting activities.\u201d The CCP might have decided to handle the five Yunnan medical workers with kid gloves, but it\u2019s not showing any sign of relaxing media controls.",

            "The mini-program, whose name roughly translates as \u201cFight the coronavirus in Yunnan\u201d, requires users to enter their phone number and receive a verification code to register. After that, they scan the \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d code when visiting public places such as airports, railway stations, subways, bus terminals, shopping malls, supermarkets, residential areas, as well as hospitals and pharmacies.",

            "Cotton, who this past weekend during an appearance on Maria Bartiromo\u2019s Fox News Channel program Sunday Morning Futures laid out how Communist China has not been honest about the origins of the coronavirus, has been the subject of vicious attacks from establishment media in the U.S. as a result.",
            "In particular, during the Bartiromo interview, Cotton specifically said there is not evidence to suggest that the coronavirus originated in a high-security biochemical lab the Chinese Communist Party government operates in Wuhan. But since the government\u2019s original official story about the virus\u2019s origin is collapsing under scrutiny, the senator argued that the question needs to be asked\u2014and that that theory, along with several other more plausible virus origin theories than the Communists\u2019 original and likely false claim that the virus originated in a food market, need to be pursued. Cotton argued that the Communists must allow internationally renowned independent western experts into China to investigate the matter.",
            "\u201cWe don\u2019t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China\u2019s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all,\u201d Cotton said in the Bartiromo interview.",

            "In his interview with Breitbart News on Monday, Cotton\u2014who is also launching a new effort to back conservative Republican veterans for Congress\u2014called on China to allow western experts into Wuhan province in China to investigate coronavirus and its origins.",
            "\u201cOf course the Chinese Communist Party needs to be open and transparent, and they have not been from the beginning as they still refuse to be,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cJust in the past couple days, they released a so-called secret speech from Chairman Xi that he supposedly gave in early January to demonstrate how on top of matters he was blaming the local officials\u2014an endemic problem to communist government. It was like a parody of historical revisionism, like old-school Marxist Leninists. What the Chinese Communist Party needs to do is open up to internationally recognized experts\u2014not Iranian experts or even Russian ones, but European and American and Canadian and Japanese\u2014where there\u2019s no question of their credentials or their integrity and allow them into Wuhan, allow them into the food market, and allow them into the super laboratory in Wuhan so they can figure out exactly where this virus came from and we can glean lessons from that to develop effective diagnostic testing and vaccines.\u201d",
            "But perhaps more importantly than that, Cotton laid out how the establishment media\u2014much of which has accused him of spreading conspiracy theories about the coronavirus\u2014is \u201cspouting\u201d Chinese Communist Party propaganda.",
            "\u201cThe second point you make though is about the media, and this is yet again a gross form of mainstream media bias\u2014they are spouting the party line, and in this case it is the Communist Party line,\u201d Cotton told Breitbart News. \u201cThey are doing everything they can to be apologists for the Chinese Communist Party when in fact it is in the Communist Party system of government that has inflicted this outbreak upon the world\u2014and most importantly upon their own people. The Chinese people, after all, are the first and worst victims of the Communist Party government in China. It\u2019s time the media start directing these questions not at skeptics in Washington, but begin directing their skepticism towards Chinese apparatchiks in Beijing.\u201d",

            "The coronavirus outbreak has exposed the United States\u2019 dangerous dependence on China for pharmaceutical and medical supplies, including an estimated 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to produce drugs in the United States.",
            "The economic repercussions of the coronavirus reveal the dangers of allowing one country to have a near monopoly on global manufacturing, David Dayen explains in an article at the American Prospect:",
            "China is a source of not only finished goods, but also of input parts and raw materials.\u00a0A\u00a0substantial number of the materials\u00a0needed for defense and electronic systems come from China, and that nation is \u201cthe single or sole supplier for a number of specialty chemicals,\u201d according to a recent Defense Department report.\u00a0Rare earth minerals, which are critical to electronics, are largely mined in China. As a result, Chinese disruptions don\u2019t just hit Chinese manufacturing, they hit everyone\u2019s. Automakers have already had to\u00a0slow or shut down factories globally\u00a0due to supply shortages.",
            "Perhaps the biggest concern is over medical supplies.\u00a0China produces and exports a\u00a0large amount of pharmaceuticals\u00a0to the U.S., including 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active ingredients used to make drugs here. Penicillin, ibuprofen, and aspirin\u00a0largely come from China.\u00a0Last month, the medical supply firm Cardinal Health\u00a0recalled 2.9 million surgical gowns\u00a0\u201ccross contaminated\u201d at a plant in China; the blood pressure drug valsartan\u00a0also saw shortages\u00a0recently, thanks to tainted active ingredients at one Chinese plant. The combination of supply chain disruptions and increased demand at hospitals if coronavirus spreads to the U.S. could prove devastating.",
            "In a dark irony,\u00a0most of the world\u2019s face masks\u2014now ubiquitous in China as a precaution\u2014are\u00a0made in China and Taiwan, and even for those made elsewhere, some component parts are Chinese-sourced. Shortages have led China to declare the masks a \u201cstrategic resource,\u201d reserving them for medical workers. U.S. hospitals are \u201ccritically low\u201d on respiratory masks, according to medical-supply middlemen.\u00a0Lack of protective gear could increase vulnerability to the virus, and the one place on earth suffering from production shutdowns is the one place where most of the protective gear originates [emphasis added].",
            "In testimony yesterday before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Scott Gottlieb, a physician and the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner in the Trump administration, explained in detail the extent of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry\u2019s dependence on China:",
            "About 40 percent of generic drugs sold in the U.S. have only a single manufacturer. A significant supply chain disruption could cause shortages for some of many of these products.",
            "Last year, manufacturing of intermediate or finished goods in China, as well as pharmaceutical source material, accounted for 95 percent of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, 91 percent of U.S. imports of hydrocortisone, 70 percent of U.S. imports of acetaminophen, 40 to 45 percent of U.S. imports of penicillin, and 40 percent of U.S. imports of heparin, according to the Commerce Department. In total, 80 percent of the U.S. supply of antibiotics are made in China.",
            "While much of the fill finishing work (the actual formulation of finished drug capsules and tablets) is done outside China (and often in India) the starting and intermediate chemicals are often sourced in China. Moreover, the U.S. generic drug industry can no longer produce certain critical medicines such as penicillin and doxycycline without these chemical components.",
            "According to a report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, China\u2019s chemical industry, which accounts for 40 percent of global chemical industry revenue, provides a large number of ingredients for drug products. It\u2019s these source materials \u2014 where in many cases China is the exclusive source of the chemical ingredients used for the manufacture of a drug product \u2014 that create choke points in the global supply chain for critical medicines.",
            "Moreover, when it comes to starting material for the manufacture of pharmaceutical ingredients, a lot of this production is centered in China\u2019s Hubei Provence, the epicenter of coronavirus. Most drug makers have a one to three-months of inventory of drug ingredients on hand. But these supplies are already being drawn down. Among big [active pharmaceutical ingredient] makers in Wuhan are Wuhan Shiji Pharmaceutical, Chemwerth, Hubei Biocause, Wuhan Calmland Pharmaceuticals. [emphasis added]",
            "Gottlieb notes that \u201c80 percent of the U.S. supply of antibiotics are made in China.\u201d The sourcing of this estimate is explained in greater detail in section three of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\u2019s 2019 report to Congress, titled \u201c Growing U.S. Reliance on China\u2019s Biotech and Pharmaceutical Products.\u201d",
            "The report notes that China is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The United States is heavily dependent on drugs that are either sourced from China or include APIs sourced from China.\u201d The report further explains that although India is the world\u2019s leading supplier of generic drugs, India gets 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients directly from China. The United States also imports 80 percent of its APIs from overseas (primarily from India and China) and \u201ca substantial portion\u201d of its generic drugs \u201ceither directly from China or from third countries like India that use APIs sourced from China.\u201d",
            "In other words, almost all pharmaceutical roads lead to China.",
            "Furthermore, the report notes that China\u2019s dominance of the chemical industry and global manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients means that \u201cthe world is becoming increasingly dependent on China as the single source for life-saving drugs.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe U.S. generic drug industry can no longer produce certain critical medicines such as penicillin and doxycycline, and the APIs needed to make these antibiotics are sourced from China,\u201d the report states.",
            "China achieved this dominance in the pharmaceutical industry by the same methods it employed to dominate the steel industry \u2013 through anti-competitive trade practices that dumped cheap state-subsidized products on foreign markets to drive competitors out of business.",
            "The report states:",
            "Rosemary Gibson, senior advisor at the Hastings Center and author of China RX, noted in her testimony before the Commission that the United States is losing its ability to produce generic drugs because Chinese drug companies dumped low-price products into the global market, which in turn pushed U.S., European, and Indian producers out of the generic drug manufacturing business. According to Ms. Gibson, China is seeking to disrupt, dominate, and displace U.S. pharmaceutical and other medical companies, and in doing so limit the United States\u2019 ability to produce its own medicines, including critical antibiotics such as penicillin and even generic aspirin. She believes the United States could see its generic drug industry made uncompetitive within five to ten years due to the Chinese government\u2019s policies (including subsidies and export incentives) that allow Chinese pharmaceutical firms to undercut prices and drive U.S. firms out of business. [emphasis added]",
            "Ironically, China\u2019s success in monopolizing the U.S. drug market with these anti-competitive trade practices was reportedly cited by President Trump\u2019s former economic adviser Gary Cohn as an argument against Trump\u2019s efforts to fight back against China\u2019s trade violations.",
            "In his book Fear: Trump in the White House, Bob Woodward describes a heated discussion among Trump administration officials about the repercussions of a trade war with China. Cohn, who disagreed with the president\u2019s decision to impose tariff\u2019s on Beijing, reportedly invoked a Commerce Department study showing that 97 percent of all U.S. antibiotics come from China. \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re the Chinese and you want to really just destroy us, just stop sending us antibiotics,\u2019 he said.\u201d",
            "Globalist critics like Cohn of Trump\u2019s trade policies \u201cfretted that turbulence from the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs would have catastrophic results on the global economy,\u201d Curtis Ellis wrote\u00a0last week in an op-ed for Breitbart News. These critics were\u00a0proven\u00a0wrong. However, the virus itself will cause economic disruptions because it \u201chas exposed the frailty of global supply chains and the fallacy of the management theory calling for intercontinental supply chains and just-in-time inventory management,\u201d Ellis writes.",
            "Or, to put it another way, the tariffs did not hurt the U.S. economy, but the current virus outbreak in China could due to the very problem that the tariffs were enacted, in part, to address.\u00a0In this sense, the virus has vindicated the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s tough trade stance and affirmed the necessity of moving the world\u2019s supply chains out of China. If anything, Trump\u2019s tariffs may have actually made the U.S. economy somewhat more resilient because they encouraged companies to begin the process of moving production out of China.",
            "But this vindication will be of little consolation to Trump if the virus\u2019s ripple effects hurt the economy during an election year. The political repercussions could be significant for a president who has touted the strong economy as a major selling point for his re-election.",
            "Economists are already expecting the virus to have a major impact on China\u2019s economy. Breitbart News\u2019s John Carney reports\u00a0that HSBC \u201clowered its estimate for the first quarter growth from an annualized rate of 5.8 percent to 4.1 percent\u201d for China. \u201cThe bank\u2019s estimate for full year growth was lowered by half a percentage point from 5.8 percent to 5.3 percent.\u201d",
            "As for the global economic impact, Dayen quotes Washington University in St. Louis professor Panos Kouvelis who estimates $300 to $400 billion in supply chain damage over a period of up to two years.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s actually manageable as a share of the global economy,\u201d Dayen writes. \u201cBut as new cases\u00a0pop up in Singapore, an important financial hub, and as the head of the World Health Organization warns that we could be seeing only the \u2018tip of the iceberg,\u2019 those numbers could already be out of date.\u201d",
            "Those numbers may indeed be overly optimistic. In his testimony before the Senate yesterday, Gottlieb warned of the potential for the coronavirus epidemic to become a full pandemic\u2013and maybe even endemic\u2013now that it has spread to Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. \u201cIt could take a new position as a more sinister member of the seasonal pathogens that circulate each year and infect humans,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cthe next month is critical.\u201d",
            "\u201cWe must prepare for the prospect that the virus evaded our border protections and was already introduced into the U.S. in late December or early January \u2014 when it first appears to have become epidemic in China\u2019s Hubei province. Those index cases could have seeded community spread, and eventually, outbreaks could emerge in America,\u201d Gottlieb\u00a0 stated.",
            "Whatever the economic impacts of the coronavirus, the current dependence on an authoritarian communist regime for vital necessities is an indictment of globalist neoliberal economic policies that have endangered U.S. national security and long-term prosperity.",
            "\u201c[T]he economic threats to locating so much of the global supply chain in one part of the world were\u00a0eminently predictable,\u201d writes Dayen. \u201cNeoliberal dogma about \u2018comparative advantage\u2019 and a concomitant preference for mass outsourcing put the world on a tenuous path.\u201d",
            "There is a growing consensus among populists on the right and left about the need to address the\u00a0neoliberal trade and economic policies that gave China a monopoly on the world\u2019s supply chains.",
            "Gottlieb urged Congress to empower the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \u201cto look not only at the supply of finished products but to also identify circumstances where key components may have only a single source across an entire category of products.\u201d",
            "Matt Stoller, author of\u00a0Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, writes that Gottlieb is essentially asking for the FDA \u201cto have the authority to uncover hidden monopolies.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe Federal Trade Commission already has this research authority, it just doesn\u2019t use it very often,\u201d Stoller explains. \u201cAnd the United States Trade Representative has information on our dependencies on China, because when they threatened tariffs large numbers of companies came to them during a notice and comment period whining about how such dependencies would hurt their business. So we have some information about the scale of the problem. Just not enough.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe strongest reason to address monopolies isn\u2019t because monopolies are unjust, but because they are dangerous,\u201d Stoller notes. \u201cAnd we may be about to find out just how dangerous they are.\u201d",
            "If nothing else, the coronavirus offers business and government leaders another reason to continue the process of decoupling the U.S. economy from China. And it also offers a warning for those who seek to simply relocate production to another developing country in order to exploit cheap labor and lax regulations. All of these short-term money-saving decisions come with long-term risk.",
            "\u201cIf there\u2019s a silver lining, it\u2019s that this threat could inspire more diversification of supply chains,\u201d Dayen writes. \u201cThe race to the bottom in manufacturing clearly has a cost, and countries must learn that self-preservation demands maintaining some semblance of an industrial base. The U.S.-China trade war did lead to some companies moving their work out of China, but only to cheaper countries where multinationals will likely conglomerate, to build economies of scale. We know the dangers inherent in that. Rebuilding domestic manufacturing is not just a question of jobs; it\u2019s a question of safety.\u201d",

Other wings of the Communist Party, meanwhile, continued to warn citizens to be silent about the outbreak in public.",
            "The repudiation from Beijing follows increasingly loud Chinese state media griping that local officials in Wuhan have failed to properly respond to the viral outbreak and attempting to redirect public outrage for the slow response to the disease from Beijing back to Wuhan. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang accepted some of the blame for the secrecy surrounding the outbreak in a press conference on Sunday, but also subtly blamed Beijing\u2019s stringent protocol for keeping quiet, insisting he did not have authority as the most powerful official in Wuhan to release public health information without Communist Party approval.",
            "The Beijing-controlled Global Times newspaper called Zhou\u2019s press conference a \u201cdisaster.\u201d",
            "Wuhan officials shut down a wild game and seafood market on January 1 after locals began hearing of a new disease spreading in the city. It took nearly a month for Chinese Communist Party officials to tell the world they had identified a never-before-seen virus spreading in the city and causing deadly pneumonia, by which millions of people had left Wuhan for Lunar New Year.",
            "The virus is believed to be highly contagious and has officially infected over 6,000 people so far, most in China.",
            "The Supreme People\u2019s Court posted a message on a Chinese social media page wryly predicting that, if Wuhan police had not started to detain and \u201chandle\u201d people who posted information about the virus online, many residents would have \u201cstarted to wear masks and carry out sanitation measures,\u201d curbing the virus\u2019s spread, the\u00a0South China Morning Post reported.",
            "\u201cIf rumours are proved [to be true] time after time, then the people will naturally choose to believe them in times of a breaking event,\u201d a judge on the top court wrote. \u201cTo punish any information not totally accurate is neither legally necessary nor technically possible. \u2026 It \u2026 undermines the credibility of the government and chips away at public support for the Communist Party. It could even be used by hostile overseas forces as an excuse to criticize us.\u201d",
            "The message was a response to Wuhan police issuing a public notice last week in which the administration claimed it had \u201chandled\u201d eight individuals for posting on social media about the virus. The notice did not detail how, exactly, the police \u201chandled\u201d those cases, and also did not identify them, leaving many to believe the people involved were arrested.",
            "\u201cSome internet users have been publishing and forwarding fake news without verification, which has had an adverse social impact,\u201d the notice reportedly read.\u00a0\u201cEight people who engaged in illegal activities were summoned and their cases handled according to law, following a police investigation.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnyone posting information and comments online should abide by [China\u2019s] laws and regulations. The police will investigate and punish anyone fabricating and spreading rumors and disrupting social order,\u201d it warned.",

Social media platforms that allow discussion uncensored by Beijing like Twitter and Facebook are banned. Despite the condemnation from the Beijing judge making the Wuhan police\u2019s response to posts about the virus seem particularly egregious, there is no information that differentiates that censorship and threat of force from typical Chinese government activity.",
            "While the police notice did not identify the offending social media statements, the\u00a0South China Morning Post cited Beijing Youth Daily as having found at least one of them: a post by a doctor in Wuhan who shared that he had treated patrons of the shut-down seafood market for symptoms of a respiratory infection. The doctor originally identified the infection as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease also caused by a coronavirus that killed nearly 800 people in a 2003 outbreak. He later suggested that the infection appeared to be caused by an unknown virus.",
            "The post identified by Beijing Youth Daily went online on December 30, two days before Chinese authorities shut down the market, but over 20 days before Beijing notified the world of the outbreak.",
            "The doctor reportedly caught the infection after being summoned to the police department and threatened into silence.",
            "The statement from the Supreme People\u2019s Court contradicted warnings in state news agency Xinhua against publishing \u201crumors\u201d about the virus on WeChat.",
            "\u201cA variety of unsubstantiated comments posted to the internet constantly stir up public panic,\u201d Xinhua reported that WeChat posted as an official warning, according to a translation by the Epoch Times. \u201cAll those who spread fake news and thus disturb social order will face up to three years in prison, detention, or disciplinary action. Those who have caused serious consequences will be given 3-year to 7-year prison terms.\u201d",
            "The\u00a0Epoch Times suggested that the WeChat warning followed an alert sent this week, and leaked to the press, by the Cyberspace Administration of China that social media sites are responsible for ensuring that non-official coronavirus news not appear on their pages.",
            "With this move, Beijing appears to be using discontent about the virus to censor social media but moving that responsibility out of the police realm and placing it in the hands of social media companies. This allows the Communist Party to more carefully control social media sites while also giving the public someone to be upset with: local Wuhan police. It also paints federal government officials as heroically protecting the public from local government overreach.",
            "Diverting public outrage at local officials began overtly after Mayor Zhou\u2019s press conference on Sunday. The\u00a0Global Times, a government mouthpiece, said that Zhou\u2019s delay in announcing an unprecedented lockdown on Wuhan was \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cshocking.\u201d",

WHO sought to cushion the bad news by saying the spike in coronavirus cases was largely due to China using better and faster testing methods, along with a clump of results from the older and slower methods coming in at the same time. The new infection standards have only been implemented in Hubei province thus far, so the total number of infections would presumably spike again if other parts of China began using the same procedures as Hubei.",

            "\u201cI\u2019ve been handling these emerging contagions for about 20 years now, and I have to tell you, I\u2019ve never seen one handled better,\u201d said Siegel of President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to the coronavirus outbreak.",
            "The Center for Disease Control (CDC) erred in its messaging with a \u201cdoom and gloom comment\u201d framing the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. as inevitable without quantifying caveats, Siegel stated.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses,\u201d said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s immunization and respiratory disease division, on Tuesday.",

            "\u201cThe task force are really top players,\u201d said Siegel, noting the task force\u2019s inclusion Dr.\u00a0Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Health\u2019s (NIH) infectious disease. Fauci is \u201cone of the top infectious disease experts in the country,\u201d he noted.",
            "Siegel noted the coronavirus task force\u2019s inclusion of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, a virologist, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, an\u00a0expert in vaccines.\u00a0",
            "\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing exactly what they\u2019re supposed to be doing,\u201d said Siegel of the Trump administration\u2019s measures towards protecting Americans from the coronavirus. \u201c[They are] restricting travel, isolating patients who are sick and, trying to cut down on contact. It\u2019s a very hard thing to do when people are pouring in from all over the world.\u201d",
            "Siegel contrasted the coronavirus\u2019s mortality rate with those of SARS, swine flu, and the flu.",
            "\u201cSARS had about a ten percent mortality [rate], but it only affected about 8,000 people,\u201d recalled Siegel. \u201cSwine flu had a very, very low mortality for flu, but flu itself really only causes about a point-four percent death rate, and [coronavirus] is about one-point-four percent. So this is killing more than flu, but I want to make a couple of points that will reassure people.\u201d",
            "Siegel continued, \u201cOne, at the beginning of an emerging contagion, it always appears more deadly than it actually is. The 1918 flu is an exception, but normally as time goes on, it\u2019s less deadly, and part of that is because you see more immunity appearing, and you also find a lot of milder cases \u2014 or even cases where people don\u2019t get sick at all. You find that as you start to test more people.\u201d",
            "Undiagnosed and asymptomatic persons infected with coronavirus are not captured in data for quantifying mortality rates, explained Siegel, \u201cMild cases that are being undiagnosed make [coronavirus] seem more deadly.\u201d",
            "The coronavirus outbreak illustrates the need for America\u2019s economy to decouple from China, assessed Siegel. ",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re relying on China for 90 percent of our ingredients for pharmaceuticals,\u201d Siegel remarked. \u201cThat hopefully will change as a result of this because we\u2019re going to end up with tremendous shortages of basic drugs, including antibiotics and blood pressure medication if this continues much longer in Wuhan.\u201d",
            "Siegel concluded, \u201cThis is a wake-up call that we must make more of our pharmaceuticals here in the United States.\u201d",
            "Asked about news media conduct regarding coronavirus, Siegel said, \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not helping because they\u2019re hyping, and the hyping leads to hysteria. ",

            "COVID-19, as the disease is known, is more lethal than the average seasonal flu, but less so than previous epidemics stemming from coronaviruses. We do not yet know its precise mortality rate. \u00a0",
            "World Health Organization data released Saturday identified 2,348 deaths from 76,392 confirmed cases in China, for a rough rate of 3.07 percent.",

            "According to the most extensive study done so far, the novel coronavirus was benign in 80.9 percent of the cases, \u201cserious\u201d in 13.8 percent and \u201ccritical\u201d in 4.7 percent.",

            "Global estimates of the mortality rate are risky however because we do not know how many people have actually been infected.",
            "Other strains of coronavirus, such as SARS and Mers, have established mortality rates of 9.5 percent and 34.5 percent, respectively.",
            "\u2013 How infectious is it?",
            "Specialists generally agree that each person who falls ill with coronavirus will infect between two and three others on average.",

            "Some experts warn however that we might be seriously underestimating the number of cases.",
            "A study published Friday by the Imperial College Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said: \u201cWe estimated that about two thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide, potentially resulting in multiple chains of as yet undetected human-to-human transmission outside mainland China.\u201d",

            "Asymptomatic cases, where people show no symptoms, are another cause for concern.",

            "\u2013 How is it transmitted?",
            "The virus is mainly transmitted by respiratory means and physical contact. Drops of saliva expelled when an infected person coughs is a common example, and researchers believe that generally occurs over a distance of around one metre (yard) at most.",
            "Health advisories emphasise measures such as washing your hands often, coughing or sneezing into the crook of your elbow or a paper handkerchief, and wearing a mask if you know you have been infected.",
            "A secondary means of transmission might be diarrhoea.",
            "\u2013 What are the symptoms and treatments?",

            "The\u00a0Epoch Times, an anti-communist publication with sources within the country, identified the funeral director only as being from Jining, Shandong province, about 450 miles from the epicenter of the viral outbreak in Wuhan. His testimony, if true, echoes similar reports of Chinese hospitals failing to confirm coronavirus cases in individuals dying of respiratory failure in areas with a high concentration of coronavirus cases. The\u00a0Epoch Times has relied on the testimony of workers at funeral homes, crematories, and other similar facilities to reveal evidence of overwhelming numbers of bodies the government must now process as a result of the outbreak.",
            "Cases of the novel coronavirus, now causing high numbers of infections in countries like Iran, Italy, and South Korea, are believed to have first began circulating in Wuhan, a regional capital of 11 million people, in December 2019. Chinese officials notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of an unidentified virus causing health issues in the city in early January, but did not alert the public until January 20. Upon China announcing the discovery of a new coronavirus, eyewitnesses in Wuhan began appealing to international media with information of \u201cpneumonia\u201d cases the government refused to confirm as coronavirus or otherwise. Others complained that, despite showing symptoms of coronavirus infection, China\u2019s government-run hospitals would not test for the virus without Communist Party approval.",
            "The Communist Party has fired or otherwise reprimanded a small number of local officials over failures in handling the outbreak, but not similarly held higher-ranking officials responsible. Dictator Xi Jinping has largely avoided the limelight, stepping out only once for a photo opportunity in Beijing and otherwise keeping to high-level meetings with other officials.",
            "Many of the cases of mishandling patients were documented in Hubei; the Jining funeral director suggests nationwide attempts to cover up the outbreak, which would implicate more powerful people than the Wuhan public officials already fired.",
            "\u201cHospitals have the capacity to write clearly the cause of death, but they didn\u2019t label it [clearly],\u201d the funeral director reportedly told the\u00a0Epoch Times. \u201cThe hospitals wrote the cause of death as unidentified pneumonia. It terrified my staff.\u201d",
            "The director reportedly identified only four or five bodies with the \u201cunidentified pneumonia\u201d label, which would be nearly twice the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the province (which currently stands at six). One mishandled body would likely be enough to contaminate the facility and infect all the staff at the funeral home, however, as health experts have warned that the Chinese coronavirus is extremely contagious and may be able to live in water droplets in the air.",
            "The\u00a0Epoch Times noted that the director said he attempted to notify local authorities of the mislabeled death certificates but received only assurances that no coronavirus deaths had occurred in Jining. The director did say he had not seen any more bodies labeled with the \u201cunidentified pneumonia\u201d tag after his several calls to the government.",
            "The newspaper reached out to hospital officials that would have handled bodies sent to the funeral director in question. They neither confirmed nor denied that the bodies were people who died of coronavirus, instead stating they either did not have the capacity to test for the virus, or they had the capacity, but were not approved to test anyone without government permission.",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus does cause pneumonia in severe cases, as do many other viruses, including coronaviruses, in sensitive patients. The funeral director\u2019s story echoes an early case of \u201cpneumonia\u201d in Wuhan that attracted attention because the government refused to test the people involved for coronavirus.",
            "Xu Dapeng, the founder of China\u2019s oldest environmental organization Friends of Nature, and his wife died of \u201cpneumonia\u201d in January in their hometown of Wuhan. His wife died ten days before Xu and before the official public announcement on January 20 of the discovery of a new virus. The couple\u2019s daughter and relatives, according to Radio Free Asia (RFA), demanded that the hospital that treated the couple both test the late patients for the new coronavirus and test them, given their proximity to the deceased. The hospital refused, stating that those alive did not have contact with any confirmed coronavirus patients, but refusing to confirm if those who died of pneumonia in their family were carriers.",
            "By February, multiple reports out of cremation facilities and funeral homes suggested that the official tally of coronavirus deaths was impossible. While most of the bodies coming into the Wuhan crematoria at the time were not confirmed coronavirus patients, the volume of remains was far higher than normal; no other explanation existed for the high number of deaths at the time. Public signs of stress at funeral homes corroborated the reports, such as advertising for dozens of extra jobs at Wuhan homes. One Wuhan advertisement sighted by RFA called for \u201capplicants aged 16-50 years old, regardless of gender, with \u2018bold and strong\u2019 personalities who have no fear of ghosts.\u201d",

Now, the information is spreading very fast and is amplified immediately in every corner of the world, basically. This speed is very difficult to address in a timely manner,\u201d Briand told Voice of America News.",
            "\u201cI think it is a challenge of the 21st century because we are all beneficiaries of those extremely intense and fast communications, but also we could be the victims of it,\u201d she said, arguing that efforts to suppress false information during a fast-moving crisis are not \u201ccensorship\u201d as the term is traditionally understood.",

            "Critics of coronavirus censorship warned that not only is speech control problematic from the standpoint of human rights and individual liberty, but it can interfere with the spread of information that can help people at risk of the disease. The eight Wuhan detainees would serve as an example since some of the material they circulated was incorrect \u2013 some of them thought SARS was making a comeback \u2013 but they were essentially right that a dangerous epidemic was spreading.",
            "The MIT Technology Review on Sunday looked at coronavirus censorship from the other direction, telling the story of Chinese citizens working to bypass government news blackouts with crowdsourced campaigns. Some of these operations overlap with networks created to support the Hong Kong protest movement, which has produced a generation of activists who know how to get around China\u2019s notorious Internet blockades.",
            "Participants in the project noted that Chinese censors are aggressively blocking posts that criticize or embarrass the government, whether or not the statements they make about the Wuhan virus are accurate. They also expressed healthy skepticism of the more dramatic \u201cunderground videos\u201d of people collapsing in the streets of Wuhan.",

",
            "The letter was suddenly retracted on Wednesday at the request of the authors, raising suspicions they were pressured to discredit themselves by the Chinese Communist Party.",
            "The letter, published on February 24, is still available in its entirety on the Lancet\u2019s website, but it has been labeled with a red \u201cRETRACTED\u201d watermark. The British journal appended a brief note to the letter explaining why it was retracted:",
            "On Feb 26, 2020, we were informed by the authors of this Correspondence that the account described therein was not a first-hand account, as the authors had claimed, and that they wished to withdraw the piece. We have therefore taken the decision to retract this Correspondence.",
            "The fact that the letter was not removed was taken by some observers as a sign the Lancet\u2019s editors believe it is genuine and the authors were pressured into requesting a retraction.\u00a0",
            "Gizmodo said on Thursday:",
            "That the authors of the letter fabricated their accounts or based them on the accounts of others who had first-hand knowledge is certainly a possibility. More plausible is that Chinese authorities interfered in this case, compelling the authors to demand that their letter be taken down \u2013 though we have not seen any direct evidence to support this possibility.",
            "When Gizmodo asked the Lancet about the letter, the response was very diplomatic and said little beyond what the original retraction note conveyed, although a spokesman added that \u201ca number of readers\u201d raised \u201cquestions regarding the validity of this correspondence\u201d even before the authors modified their position and claimed their information was second-hand:",
            "\u201cQuestions regarding the validity of this correspondence were brought to our attention by a number of readers,\u201d wrote a Lancet media spokesperson to Gizmodo in an email. \u201cIn addition, we received a direct communication from the authors of this correspondence \u2026 stating that the account they described was not first-hand, as they had originally claimed in the correspondence, and that they wished to withdraw the piece. Following due process according to the COPE retraction guidelines, we determined that it was our duty to retract this correspondence.\u201d",
            "To which the spokesperson added: \u201cEvery piece of original research published across The Lancet Group is subject to peer-review. However, we also publish a range of additional content, including correspondence, which is not. In these instances, we take the perspectives provided by authors on trust.\u201d",
            "Reuters added that a medical team sent from Guangdong province, where Guangzhou is located, to the virus outbreak epicenter in Wuhan \u201cposted an online statement to a newspaper saying the two were not part of the team and their description of conditions was not accurate.\u201d",
            "Of course, such a statement would be expected if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) decided to discredit a pair of troublesome nurses, and while the Lancet did not divulge the identity of the \u201cnumber of readers\u201d who questioned the validity of the letter, every longtime observer of Chinese politics is familiar with swarms of \u201cnetizens\u201d besieging foreign corporations and media outlets with complaints that echo the CCP party line.",
            "Gizmodo and Reuters tried to get in touch with the original authors, Yingchun Zeng of Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical Hospital and Yan Zhen of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital in Guangzhou. Neither responded, and Zhen did not report for work on Thursday, a development Gizmodo viewed \u201cquite ominously.\u201d Even more ominously, the second time Reuters tried to contact Zhen, someone at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial said the hospital had no employee by that name.",
            "According to the letter they wrote to the Lancet, Zeng and Zhan were nurses dispatched to Wuhan to assist with the coronavirus response by working in an isolation ward, providing what they described as \u201cbasic nursing care\u201d to patients.",
            "The conditions they reported seeing in the isolation ward were very different from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official narrative about an outbreak coming under control after diligent and professional work by well-trained and well-equipped doctors.\u00a0",
            "Zeng and Zhan pleaded for help from the international community to cope with an epidemic out of control and an over-stressed Chinese medical system on the brink of collapse:",
            "The conditions and environment here in Wuhan are more difficult and extreme than we could ever have imagined. There is a severe shortage of protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, face shields, goggles, gowns, and gloves. The goggles are made of plastic that must be repeatedly cleaned and sterilised in the ward, making them difficult to see through. Due to the need for frequent hand washing, several of our colleagues\u2019 hands are covered in painful rashes. As a result of wearing an N95 respirator for extended periods of time and layers of protective equipment, some nurses now have pressure ulcers on their ears and forehead. When wearing a mask to speak with patients, our voices are muted, so we have to speak very loudly. Wearing four layers of gloves is abnormally clumsy and does not work\u2014we can\u2019t even open the packaging bags for medical devices, so giving patients injections is a huge challenge. In order to save energy and the time it takes to put on and take off protective clothing, we avoid eating and drinking for 2 hours before entering the isolation ward. Often, nurses\u2019 mouths are covered in blisters. Some nurses have fainted due to hypoglycaemia and hypoxia.",
            "In addition to the physical exhaustion, we are also suffering psychologically. While we are professional nurses, we are also human. Like everyone else, we feel helplessness, anxiety, and fear. Experienced nurses occasionally find the time to comfort colleagues and try to relieve our anxiety. But even experienced nurses may also cry, possibly because we do not know how long we need to stay here and we are the highest-risk group for COVID-19 infection. So far 1716 Chinese staff have been infected with COVID-19 and nine of them have unfortunately passed away. Due to an extreme shortage of health-care professionals in Wuhan, 14\u2008000 nurses from across China have voluntarily come to Wuhan to support local medical health-care professionals. But we need much more help. We are asking nurses and medical staff from countries around the world to come to China now, to help us in this battle.",
            "\u201cWe hope the COVID-19 epidemic will end soon, and that people worldwide will remain in good health. We declare no competing interests,\u201d the nurses concluded, presumably anticipating Communist Party efforts to discredit them."

            "Africa is currently battling outbreaks of Ebola, measles, cholera, polio, and Lassa fever, among other diseases. Central Africa \u2013 particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Kenya, and Zimbabwe \u2013 are considered some of the most sensitive areas, as state infrastructure is weak, much of the population lives in poverty, and governments are already fighting other deadly diseases. Yet many of these nations have significant exposure to travel from China, where the virus originated, due to governments cutting deals with the Communist Party, making them likely stops for infected travelers.",
            "The novel coronavirus began infecting people in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people, in December. On January 1, Chinese authorities shut down a wild meat market in the city believed to have been where the virus jumped from animals to humans for the first time. Beijing took nearly a month after making that discovery to alert Wuhan residents to the presence of a contagious disease, resulting in local hospitals not isolating coronavirus carriers, thereby exposing sensitive patients to the disease. The city of Wuhan also allowed five million people to leave before instituting a lockdown, spreading the virus to every province in the country.",
            "The Egyptian Health Ministry confirmed a coronavirus case on Friday, identifying the person only as a \u201cforeigner,\u201d according to the country\u2019s\u00a0al-Ahram newspaper. Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Megahed said the individual was not exhibiting any outward symptoms, adding to mounting evidence that the virus takes days or even weeks to manifest. Some doctors have suggested that coronavirus patients without outward symptoms may still be contagious, prompting the Egyptian government to place the individual in quarantine.",
            "Megahed also noted that the patient traveled into Egypt recently and authorities caught his case by isolating and testing all individuals entering the country from nations that have documented cases of the virus. The Ministry did not state the identity of the patient, where he had traveled from, or if they are monitoring others who entered the country with him.",
            "The World Health Organization (WHO), which Egypt has notified and engaged in coronavirus response, identified the patient as a man.",
            "\u201cThe case was transferred as a foreign person to the hospital for isolation, follow-up and health check, as the case carries the virus and does not show any symptoms, and his condition is completely stable,\u201d the WHO\u2019s Egypt office posted on Twitter Sunday.",
            "Egypt had already canceled departing and arriving flights from China on January 30 for at least the next month, the\u00a0South China Morning Post noted\u00a0and is currently handling cases of Egyptian nationals brought home from affected areas.\u00a0Al-Ahram, citing the Egyptian Health Ministry, reported that the 302 Egyptians evacuated from Wuhan\u00a0concluded their mandatory 14-day isolation on Monday, and all tested negative for the virus.",

Most nations have ignored this advice, leading to a two-thirds drop in the number of flights leaving China less than a month since it revealed the existence of the novel coronavirus.",
            "Precautionary measures have limited most cases to Chinese borders. At press time, global health officials have identified 71,811 people as confirmed coronavirus cases, the overwhelming majority of them within China. Another 1,775 people have died of the virus, most in China, except isolated cases in the\u00a0Philippines, Taiwan, France, Japan, and Hong Kong. The Diamond Princess, a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan after a person on board tested positive for coronavirus, is now home to 369 cases out of 2,500 people on board \u2013 more than any other country, except China.",

            "WHO officials and others in the health industry have identified Africa as a particularly vulnerable continent for an outbreak, however, given its ties to China and its weak healthcare systems. Nations that have signed onto the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) \u2013 a worldwide plan in which China invests millions in building roads, ports, and railways through predatory loans, then seizes those projects from the countries they are built in \u2013 have taken in thousands of Chinese workers, many of whom flagrantly violate\u00a0local immigration policies to stay and work illegally, particularly in Kenya. The programs, which have resulted in Chinese government officials instituting racist policies against Africans in their own countries, have triggered a widespread backlash against the Chinese government, which has led to some movements in Africa\u00a0banning Chinese citizens until the coronavirus outbreak wanes.",

Iran has thus far reported 139 infections and 19 fatalities.",

            "The head of a medical university in Qom publicly stated that doctors have been ordered not to disclose coronavirus statistics to the public. Most testing has been routed through Iran, a cumbersome process that jeopardizes patients, but gives the regime the power to control how many cases are divulged to the public and the outside world.",
            "Health experts have noted that Iran\u2019s claimed mortality rate from the coronavirus is up to ten times higher than the rate reported by other countries, which suggests that either a large number of mild infections are not being detected by Iranian doctors \u2013 a grim possibility from the standpoint of controlling the epidemic, since it would mean many contagious Iranians have not been detected \u2013 or the government is lying about the total number of infections while admitting to deaths that cannot easily be concealed."

            "That gave them more chance of containing the virus, and more time to prepare for it.",
            "\u201cWe in Germany were simply at the forefront in terms of diagnostics,\u201d said Christian Drosten, the director of the Institute for Virology at Berlin\u2019s Charite hospital.",

Authorities announced Monday, however, that an 89-year-old in the western city of Essen and a person in Heinsberg county near the Dutch border died of COVID-19. Both locations are in North Rhine-Westphalia state, which has accounted for 484 of the 1,112 infections confirmed in Germany to date.",

            "\u201cThese effects combined, I\u2019m very certain of this, gave us an extreme advantage in recognizing the epidemic in Germany,\u201d Drosten told reporters in Berlin.",

            "The move is especially noteworthy because those two cities are key elements of China\u2019s high-tech economic engine.",
            "Shenzhen and Guangzhou are located in Guangdong province, which has been hit by the most coronavirus cases outside Hubei, where the epidemic began. As of Wednesday, Shenzhen reported 375 confirmed infections and Guangzhou reported 317, while the province has a total of 1,177.",
            "In both of the big Guangdong cities, legislators approved emergency measures that would enable officials to temporarily seize homes, commercial property, public venues, and vehicles thought to be contaminated, as well as commanding private businesses to produce any materials deemed necessary in fighting the coronavirus. Shortages of medical equipment and protective gear have been a persistent problem in areas where the virus is spreading, and shortages of food and supplies for quarantined populations are becoming a serious issue.",
            "Shezhen\u2019s emergency legislation also gives the city government broad powers to shut down commercial operations, public events, schools, and other venues where the virus could spread rapidly.",
            "Guangdong\u2019s provincial legislature is considering similar measures, with more of an emphasis on emergency quarantine measures and transportation restrictions than seizing private property.",
            "Government officials seizing personal property might not seem like a big story in a Communist country, but laws that semi-approved the ownership of property passed over a decade ago played a major role in China\u2019s rapid economic expansion. The emergency measures passed in Guangdong mark the first time local governments have seized property since the passage of the 2007 Property Law.",
            "The Property Law included provisions for just this type of emergency seizure, with requirements that the property must be returned and the owners duly compensated. The Epoch Times on Tuesday noted some apprehension in China\u2019s tech hub cities that the ruling regime might not honor those commitments, especially if the economic damage from the coronavirus epidemic is severe:",
            "Heng He, a U.S.-based political affairs commentator, expressed skepticism about such measures. Although similar emergency policies have been utilized in other countries, Heng expressed concern about the regime\u2019s capacity to honor its pledge to provide compensation.",

            "Forced demolition campaigns have been a recurring issue in China over the past two decades. According to a 2019 report by Beijing Shengting Law Firm, at least 751 complaints were filed from 2014 to 2017 over forced demolitions; and in 43 percent of the cases the officials did not follow any legal procedures.",
            "China also has persistent problems with corruption, despite endless high-profile campaigns against it. The Epoch Times cited reports of local officials already abusing quarantine situations for profit, such as by demanding bribes to enter restricted areas or bypass checkpoints. This misbehavior also calls the effectiveness of China\u2019s much-touted lockdowns into question, since people infected by the coronavirus are no less capable of paying bribes than healthy people.",
            "The fact that China\u2019s prestige economic zone is passing emergency laws to seize property has been taken by skeptical observers, both within and outside China, as another sign that the epidemic is much worse than Beijing is willing to admit. At the moment, the official line from the Chinese government is that the epidemic will peak in February and will effectively end by April.",
            "Another sign of desperation spotted by Quartz on Monday is a risky gambit in several Chinese cities to flush out coronavirus sufferers in hiding by refusing to sell them fever and cough medicine.",
            "The brutal calculation is that people who have been hiding their infections and self-medicating \u2013 which the Chinese government explicitly told them to do at first \u2013 will be forced to reveal themselves and seek treatment from doctors.\u00a0",
            "Critics of the policy fear it will be counter-productive because it will force people with illnesses other than the Wuhan virus to expose themselves to the deadly epidemic by visiting hospitals and clinics full of infected people. Even worse, those overwhelmed medical centers often send patients home without treatment or testing and tell them to self-medicate, so many people will be compelled to expose themselves to the Wuhan virus for nothing.",
            "\u201cIs this policy reasonable? People could originally resolve the illnesses with drugs instead of going to hospitals to grab already stretched medical resources and being infected by others who have the virus,\u201d one Chinese social media commentator noted."

            "In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar obtained exclusively by Breitbart News ahead of its public release, Cotton raises serious public health concerns over the coronavirus and in particular the disease making its way to America\u2019s shores through weak screening that could cause an outbreak here.",
            "\u201cI write to you today about the continued spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, which has now arrived on American soil,\u201d Cotton wrote in the Wednesday letter, which came after the first U.S. case of coronavirus was confirmed in Washington state earlier this week. \u201cOnce again, a deadly virus is emanating from the People\u2019s Republic of China. The Wuhan coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China, killing at least seventeen individuals so far. The disease has now spread to Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea. At least one case has been confirmed in the United States. I\u2019m confident that the United States Government is undertaking all possible measures to contain the spread of the disease, but I\u2019m deeply concerned that waging an efficient and successful campaign against this virus depends on the trustworthiness and transparency of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), an organization with a horrendous history in these matters.\u201d",

The outbreak origins of the Wuhan coronavirus, the Cotton aide noted, is \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the SARS outbreak\u2014something even the New York Times agrees with. Cotton, the aide told Breitbart News, wants to be sure that HHS and the whole U.S. government approach the Chinese Communists\u2019 handling of this disease scare with \u201cextreme skepticism\u201d and \u201cprepare for the worst.\u201d",

            "Sen. Cotton noted in his letter to Azar that the Chinese Communist Party has a history of providing misleading and false information on public health scares.",
            "\u201cAs you know, in the past the CCP has lied, falsified statistics, and suppressed information about the outbreak of disease in order to protect its political standing and cover for its own incompetence,\u201d Cotton wrote. \u201cIn 2002 and 2003, the SARS virus killed nearly 800 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide after the CCP denied there was even a health crisis. During the outbreak, CCP officials imposed a months-long blackout on media coverage of the disease. The CCP, with its totalitarian Marxist-Leninistideology, reflexively covers up scandals that could threaten its power.\u201d",
            "He urged Secretary Azar to immediately brief Congress if the administration becomes aware of misinformation from the Chinese Communists with regard to the coronavirus.",
            "\u201cFor these reasons, the CCP\u2019s calls for transparency about the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus are deeply suspect,\u201d Cotton wrote. \u201cI urge the Department of Health and Human Services to carefully vet any information being passed from its contacts in Beijing.

            "The plunge in global markets on Monday will no doubt add a sense of urgency to the high-level meetings at the White House Monday afternoon aimed at formulating coronavirus economic policy responses.",
            "There are several steps the Trump administration can take to combat the economic drag from the coronavirus. These would likely prevent a recession from taking hold\u2014or at least ensure that any downturn would be mild and short-lived. They would also likely alleviate some of the market panic by demonstrating that the federal government is taking its responsibility to stabilize the economy seriously.",
            "Federally Funded Sick Leave. While most U.S. workers have paid sick leave provided by their employers, close to one-third do not. Many of those without sick-leave are lower-income hourly or tipped workers. They are less likely to have access to \u2018rainy-day\u2019 funds to get them through a period of weeks without income.",
            "This creates a dangerous incentive for workers who may have coronavirus but are not cripplingly ill to continue to show up to work, risking infecting coworkers, customers, and people they encounter on their commute. For the sake of containing the virus, we need to compensate these workers for performing the public service of staying home if they are sick.",
            "The loss of income for these workers also threatens to have a destabilizing ripple effect on the economy by diminishing consumer spending. Obviously, workers who are not receiving incomes will need to reduce their spending. But many workers who are healthy will also reduce their discretionary spending in order to build a financial cushion in case they get sick. In an economy that is highly dependent on consumer spending, this could have serious deleterious consequences.",
            "Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer seem to be calling for mandatory employer-provided paid sick leave, something the American left has long demanded. This would be a mistake, especially right now. Many of the businesses that do not currently provide paid sick leave are small enough that having to pay employees who are unexpectedly not working would be unsustainable. That is even more so when public fears over the coronavirus are slowing sales at restaurants, retail shops, and other public places.",
            "Fortunately, there\u2019s a better alternative\u2014federally funded sick leave. The U.S. government should announce that it stands ready to send checks to employees with coronavirus. (If it is easier to administer, it can send the checks to employers who keep paying their workers.) This has the added advantage of putting the burden of paying the bills on the institution with the lowest costs of funds, the federal government. With Treasury yields all now solidly below one percent, the government can easily afford to add to the deficit to pay for sick leave.",
            "Parents Too. This sick leave should also be available to workers with children in areas where schools have been closed. It would be counter-productive to close schools but expect parents to find alternative daycare centers for their school-aged children. If schools pose a danger of spreading the virus, daycare centers will also. So we need to compensate parents for the income we want them to forego by not working. This is not a handout\u2014it is buying compliance from individuals in a way that delivers the rest of us public health benefits.",
            "Supersize Unemployment Benefits. In ordinary circumstances, we do not want unemployment benefits to pay too much or last too long because that risks disincentivizing the unemployed from seeking work. When layoffs occur because the underlying economy is shifting away from employment in one industry, we want employees to seek employment in other industries.",
            "This does not apply to Americans who may find themselves out of work temporarily because people have greatly reduced their spending on recreation, travel, tourism, and eating out. There\u2019s no need to worry about keeping the \u201creservation wage\u201d too high\u2014at least in the short-term. So go ahead and expand unemployment benefits\u2014increase the amount available and the length\u2014especially in industries and areas hardest hit.",
            "This will have the added benefit of discouraging panic savings, at least a bit, because people will be more confident that they will be able to maintain their consumption if they lose their jobs. And when they do lose their jobs, it will prevent consumer spending from plummeting\u2014acting as an automatic stabilizer for the economy.",
            "This should be federally funded. State budgets are likely to be strained by falling employment, slower economic growth, and demands for public services. The federal government\u2019s ability to borrow at ultra-low rates makes it the ideal source of funding here.",
            "Small Business Tax Holiday. Small businesses should be allowed to defer tax payments for the duration of the public health crisis. This will provide them with a source of liquidity if sales crash due to a public panic.",
            "Payroll Tax Cuts. Temporarily ease the tax burden on workers and businesses by suspending part of the payroll tax. That will immediately raise the take-home pay of workers, adding support to consumer spending and allowing households to pay debts or save to bolster their balance sheets. Think of it as temporarily substituting the lower borrowing costs of the federal government for the higher borrowing costs of the household sector.",
            "Basic Income Guarantee. With any luck, we will not have a U.S. version of Wuhan, a city that basically is forced to shut down entirely because of an outbreak. But if we do, the government should stand ready to support the incomes of the people of any severely geographically affected area with cash payments akin to disaster relief provided for victims of floods or hurricanes.",
            "Expand Small Business Loan Support. The government should provide generous, low-interest loans and loan guarantees to small businesses. Even big businesses in sectors hardest hit\u2014such as airlines\u2014should be able to tap temporary government-sponsored lending facilities. We already do this for banks and other financial institutions. Faced with the threat of the coronavirus, it makes sense to extend the idea of the government being the lender of last resort to the non-financial business sector.",
            "Free Testing and Affordable Treatment. Testing for the uninsured should be paid for by the federal government\u2014as should treatment for the confirmed cases that require hospitalization or expensive prescription drugs. We want to encourage widespread testing. We do not want American families worried about facing financial ruin if a loved one needs to be hospitalized for coronavirus.",
            "And when a vaccine is developed, make sure it is available free to every American.",
            "Keep America Great. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign was controversial because he insisted on talking about threats to America and the failures of American policymakers that other politicians and the media ignored, such as immigration and bad trade deals. That is also why it was successful. Trump told us he could see the threats the rest of us could see and would take action to fix things.",
            "That\u2019s what the American economy and financial markets need today. We elected a president who would set things right. We elected a man of action. It would be a tragedy if the president\u2019s advisers convinced him to mimic predecessors who denied the devastation delivered upon America\u2019s industrial heartland and laughed at the idea that America needed to be made great again.",
            "In a crisis, when people seem to be panicking, the government needs to step in as a source of stability. The U.S. government, almost uniquely in the world, sees its own cost of funding fall in crises, as Treasury yields have once again been demonstrating. It does not have to worry about a deteriorating balance sheet or diminished cash flows because when danger arises, investors worldwide demand our government\u2019s bonds.",
            "\u201cGovernments can be a ballast of cool stability while individuals are justifiably terrified. In other words, governments can be counter-cyclical in the broadest sense of the term,\u201d Joe Weisenthal at Bloomberg wrote in a newsletter Monday.",
            "We can\u2019t keep America great by ignoring the threat of coronavirus. But if President Trump acts with his characteristic boldness and decisiveness, coronavirus cannot keep us from being great."

            "All but one of the Iranian coronavirus cases were reported from the city of Qom, a large city and provincial capital located about 80 miles south of Tehran. The fifth case was described as a doctor from Qom who became ill from the coronavirus while visiting the city of Arak, another provincial capital about 80 miles from Qom that is known internationally for the presence of a heavy-water nuclear reactor.\u00a0",
            "Iranian health officials urged the temporary suspension of religious gatherings in Qom, regarded as a holy city under Iran\u2019s dominant religion of Shia Islam. Schools and universities in Qom have also been closed while the infections are investigated.",
            "The two victims killed by the coronavirus were described in Iranian media reports as \u201celderly\u201d people who have never traveled abroad, or even traveled outside of Qom province before they took ill. According to a health ministry spokesman, they died as a result of their \u201cold age and deficient immune systems.\u201d\u00a0",
            "All five of the patients are said to be Iranian nationals. Iranian officials claim there have been no reports of infection outside of Qom. Sources told the BBC at least 25 people are quarantined in the same hospital in Iran under suspicion they might have contracted the coronavirus.",

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ordered the establishment of a national coronavirus prevention committee, government spokesman Ali Rabiei said Thursday. The committee will include ministers of health and roads in addition to a representative of the armed forces,\u201d the Journal reported.",

            "Local officials confirmed that the suspect, named\u00a0as 25-year-old Xiao, reportedly broke into the woman\u2019s bedroom last Friday night in the city of Jingshan, around three hours from Wuhan.",

He then took\u00a03,080 yuan ($440) in cash before fleeing the scene.",
            "In a statement posted on Chinese social media, the local police department described the incident in detail, noting how Xiao left his home following an argument with his family in search of things to burgle. The post also included a bizarre cartoon of a man eyeing up someone\u2019s valuables through an open window.",
            "\u201cXiao was frightened when he heard my claims, and quickly grabbed the bedside phone worth 3,000 yuan and a bag of more than 80 yuan in cash before fleeing the scene,\u201d the girl told police.",
            "Yi contacted the police right away and a manhunt was launched in the town. However, efforts were somewhat hampered by the fact that all locals were wearing face masks to protect themselves from infection. Eventually, Xiao reportedly surrendered himself to police alongside his father and admitted wrongdoing, saying he went out with the intent to commit robbery. He is currently being held in detention.",
            "As of Monday afternoon, Chinese authorities claimed that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus is fast approaching 25,000. Another 494 people have died as a result of the virus, and 980 have made recoveries. There are concerns that China may be lying about the numbers of those infected, as Beijing seeks to protect the country\u2019s economic interests as countries around the world urge their citizens to avoid the Chinese mainland.",
            "With the virus now spreading sporadically around the world, including within the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) last week\u00a0declared\u00a0the outbreak as an international health emergency.",
            "\u201cThe main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on announcing the emergency. \u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\u201d",

She had to call for help to get medical staff to examine him during his final hours, and she had to call for an ambulance herself when she was told he needed to return to the hospital, a journey he did not live to complete.",

            "Under rules imposed by Wuhan city health authorities, patients will now be discharged only if they display seven days of normal body temperature, high levels of blood oxygen saturation, improved lung condition, and negative results from at least two tests for the coronavirus. Additionally, hospitals are now monitoring patients for the presence of antibodies that indicate their bodies are fighting a coronavirus infection, a test devised within the past two weeks by Chinese virologists.",
            "The notice imposing these rules did not mention Li by name, but it did say there have recently been \u201cmany relapsed patients who were later treated at hospitals again.\u201d",
            "The first rumblings of significant relapse or reinfection problems were heard in late February in Japan and China, leading doctors to suspect the coronavirus can go dormant and lurk in the body until the antibodies created to combat it have dissipated.",
            "Another complication is that scientists believe there are at least two strains of the Wuhan coronavirus, one of them more virulent and dangerous than the other. The significance of the second strain is still hotly debated among epidemiologists,\u00a0but it could complicate the lives of patients who recover from one strain and are subsequently exposed to the other \u2014 a significant danger for patients like Li who are obliged to spend a long period recovering in one of China\u2019s improvised, crowded, and dubiously sanitary quarantine facilities."

            "The\u00a0Global Times, a Chinese state propaganda newspaper, quoted a Beijing official at the General Office of the State Council blaming local officials for a particularly embarrassing incident in which Wuhan health workers intended to transfer coronavirus patients from their homes to hospitals \u2013 Wuhan officials had told those with symptoms to self-medicate at home for the first month of the outbreak.",
            "After weeks of reports of ill patients demanding treatment at hospitals and urging doctors to test them to confirm their condition and being turned away, the Communist Party announced it would take in all patients languishing in their homes at once on Sunday. The result, according to Chinese state media itself, was a disaster:",
            "Due to the lagging work, disorderly liaison and organization of the Wuchang district government, the conditions of the transfer buses were poor and there was no working staff from the community following the car. This led to critically ill patients waiting for a long time and getting emotional.",
            "Global Times reporters in Wuhan tagged along with one transfer operation in the city\u2019s Wuchang district around Sunday midnight. And they saw that the bus designated for the transfer operation was a public city bus, which was loaded with more than 30 senior patients who were seriously ill.",
            "The number of patients outnumbered the seats, and some who were standing grew so exhausted that they sat down on the aisle.",
            "There were no quarantine measures between the bus driver and the patients, and the bus driver himself was not in a standard protective outfit required for contact with critically ill patients.",
            "The\u00a0Global Times cataloged the one bus driver suffering \u201cseveral emotional breakdowns\u201d while those he was attempting to transport broke down in tears. After hours of getting lost on the way to the hospital, several patients reportedly collapsed upon getting out of the bus.",
            "The Chinese Communist Party appears to have chosen to be transparent about the horrifying conditions surrounding this transport \u2013 unlike the many reports of Chinese police welding families shut in buildings to keep the virus from spread \u2013 because it is holding Wuhan officials solely responsible for the chaos.",
            "\u201cWe need to do good things well. How can we turn good things to bad? Why did these Party members and officials responsible for transferring these critically ill patients not follow the car? Wuhan is now in wartime. These people behaved very badly,\u201d General Office of the State Council, Gao Yu, reportedly berated Wuhan officials \u201csummoned\u201d before their Beijing superiors.",

            "The stern report criticizing Wuhan officials followed what appeared to be the beginning of a political purge in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, on Tuesday. Communist officials dismissed the head of Hubei\u2019s public health commission Liu Yingzi and the Communist Party member overseeing the agency, Zhang Jin, for failing to adequately respond to the crisis. Last week, officials announced their first government firings: the mayor of Huajiahe, a village in Hubei, and the Communist Party secretary of the village.",
            "The Huajiahe officials were dismissed following the death of a teen boy with cerebral palsy. The boy, identified as Yan Cheng, could not eat, drink, bathe, or engage in other necessary human functions without aid, yet government officials quarantined his family on suspicions of coronavirus contamination, leaving him alone in his home.",
            "The first official to offer his resignation if needed, Mayor Zhou Xianwang of Wuhan, remains in office at press time. In a press conference in January, Zhou admitted to being aware of the coronavirus outbreak long before instituting measures to protect the public from a larger outbreak, but only announced a city-wide lockdown after 5 million of the city\u2019s 11 million residents had left, most on vacation during the Lunar New Year holiday. Zhou also blamed senior Communist Party officials for his secrecy.",

[Coronavirus] is a contagious disease. Contagious diseases have relevant law and information needs to be disclosed according to law.\u201d",

            "The authorities believe the virus may have spread through poorly-designed toilets and bathroom pipes in the public housing project.",
            "The South China Morning Post (SCMP) described the plumbing problem:",
            "A Housing Department policy change has allowed tenants in government flats to alter the pipe design in their bathrooms since 2016, a problem which might have helped the faster spread of the deadly new coronavirus which led to an evacuation of a Tsing Yi housing block on Tuesday, the Post has found.",
            "Opened to residents in 1986, Hong Mei House is one of 13 blocks of flats on the Cheung Hong Estate. The 35-storey building is made up of 840 units in three wings, dubbed a Y2 design.",
            "According to the original design of the bathroom, the toilet is located in the centre of the unit, with all outlets, including the waste pipe and vent pipe exposed and connected with the bowl.",
            "Health officials evacuated over 30 units that had piping systems similar to those in the apartments of a 62-year-old woman and 75-year-old man who became infected. The two infected residents lived ten floors apart, but the virus may have spread between their apartments through the piping system.",
            "The problem, as Housing Minister Frank Chan-fan explained, is that many residents have altered the safe but ungainly piping arrangement in their bathrooms, creating unsafe situations where \u201cfoul air\u201d can spread between units because the vent pipes have been retrofitted or disconnected entirely. Newer apartments have their bathroom pipes discreetly hidden inside the walls, so the residents are not likely to modify them.",
            "Such alterations were not permitted for public housing tenants until the revised guidelines were issued in 2016. The SCMP cited speculation that the rules were changed mainly to relieve some of the burden on the housing department, which lacked the manpower to perform all the inspections needed under the older, stricter guidelines.",
            "Chan-fan stressed that the coronavirus did not spread through water pipes and toilets, but rather through air vent pipes bundled into the plumbing system. This clarification was important because the 2003 SARS epidemic was known to spread through faulty plumbing.",
            "Medical researchers are still working to determine how the Wuhan virus spreads. Although direct human contact is normally thought to be necessary, Hong Kong doctors suggested the virus might have passed between the two Hong Mei House apartments when infected fecal matter passed into the altered ventilation system.",

The\u00a0Epoch Times itself has for decades maintained ties with Falun Gong and relayed the report from a Falun Gong website, Minghui.",

His wife reportedly died in early December of a fatal fall that occurred as she fled police; she also faced charges of practicing Falun Gong.",

The Communist Party considers practitioners members of a terrorist cult despite no evidence of violent activity by Falun Gong followers in the country. For decades, Falun Gong practitioners have faced extreme persecution, arrest, torture, and death, and have reportedly been Beijing\u2019s primary target for the illegal harvesting of organs to sell on the black market.",

He didn\u2019t know how to talk, eat, or take care of himself,\u201d according to the website. \u201cHe often fainted. His urine was milky-white. He suffered constant chest pain and had trouble breathing. He also had heavy sweats that often soaked his bedding and clothes.\u201d",
            "In past reports, Minghui has described Gong as \u201cmentally disabled\u201d after experiencing torture in police custody. In 2008, Minghui accused the Communist Party of abducting Gong at the turn of the century in response to him making a public appeal to end the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners:",
            "In 2000, Mr. Gong went to Beijing to appeal for Falun Gong. He was arrested and detained in Yilan County for 34 days. While in detention, the county police tortured him brutally. They beat him, pushed tooth-picks under his fingernails, and rubbed his ribs with sharp-edged, hard objects. Once the police used electric batons to shock him, making him vomit and lose control of his bowels. In the meantime, police officers Han Yunjie (who later died unexpectedly) and Liu Chen ransacked Mr. Gong\u2019s home. It was winter. They even took the family\u2019s pots and pans. Liu Chen threatened Mr. Gong\u2019s wife, saying, \u201cIf we can\u2019t make you suffer, we will make your husband suffer.\u201d (Mr. Gong\u2019s wife was pregnant at the time.)",
            "The alleged use of the coronavirus outbreak to persecute political dissidents and enemies of the communist state highlights concerns of totalitarian measures that arose nearly immediately after reports began to circulate of a \u201cmystery pneumonia\u201d killing people in Wuhan. Reports indicate that residents of Wuhan became aware of a sickness spreading in mid-December, but authorities only acted in early January, shutting down a wild meat market on January 1 suspected of being the origin of the virus. Beijing alerted the public to the discovery of an unidentified form of coronavirus on January 20, not warning health officials to isolate potential carriers until then.",
            "Two weeks before that public alert, however, the government of Hong Kong greatly expanded isolation powers, citing the mystery illness as the reason. A new ordinance approved by Chief Executive Carrie Lam gave \u201clegal powers to health authorities to isolate patients suspected of contracting an unidentified virus after visiting Wuhan.\u201d The ordinance inspired fears that the government would falsely accuse Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters of being suspected virus carriers and quarantine them, preventing free assembly. At press time, no accusations of such abuse of that ordinance have surfaced.",
            "In Wuhan itself, however, the Chinese government immediately silenced individuals who attempted to discuss the viral outbreak before January 20. In one particularly prominent case, Wuhan police detained a doctor, 34-year-old Li Wenliang, for posting in a private WeChat group that he believed the illness spreading in the city was contagious. Police forced him to sign a humiliating statement confessing to \u201cseverely disturbing public order\u201d by discussing the disease. Li died last week, allegedly after contracting the virus, a rare death as most killed by the virus are seniors or individuals already facing other illnesses.",

            "\u201cAmazon is also telling employees who have recently traveled to areas in China affected by the virus to work from home for two weeks and, if they experience symptoms, to seek medical attention before coming back into the office,\u201d Business Insider reported.",
            "\u201cFacebook suspended non-essential travel to mainland China and told employees who had traveled there to work from home,\u201d the New York Times reported.",
            "Many Chinese migrants work in elite technology companies, not in the myriad lower-tier software sweatshops around the United States. Many others work in banks and financial-sector companies, so several U.S. financial-services companies are curbing employee travel to China.",
            "Understandably, companies do not want to talk about their employees \u2014 and especially their number of Chinese-born employees. But the workforce numbers can be estimated from government data \u2014 and those numbers suggest Amazon and Microsoft each employ more than 6,000 Chinese graduates with relatives in China.",
            "The website, MyVisaJobs.com, uses federal data to track job opportunities for foreign graduates in the United States.",
            "The data shows that employers nationwide nominated 11,153 Chinese-born migrants for green cards in 2019, 12,612 in 2018, 8,603 in 2017, and 7,217 in 15. Overall, or 59,870 Chinese has been nominated for green cards since 2010 by U.S. employers. Nearly all of those requests are approved by the government, after a short delay.",
            "The MyVisaJobs data shows that Amazon and its various affiliates have nominated 2,736 Chinese employees for green cards since 2013. Not all those nominated were approved \u2014 but the companies still employed those workers.",
            "Amazon also hired many H-1B workers from China.",
            "The MyVisaJobs site tracks Amazon\u2019s requests to get to H-1B visas for almost 4,000 new foreign hires in the last three years \u2014 but it does not provide the nationalities. The federal government likey approved 1,500 of the 4,000 visa requests.",
            "The company also sought to\u00a0extend or modify H-1B visas for roughly 13,000 other H-1B workers during the last three years. The Department of Homeland Security would likely have approved nearly all of the requests, but it does not reveal their nationalities.",
            "But one-third of Amazon\u2019s green-cards nominations go to Chinese workers, so a cautious estimate would say that one-quarter of Amazon\u2019s H-1B visa-workers are Chinese. If that estimate is correct, then Amazon employs roughly 5,000 Chinese-born H-1B visa workers.",
            "To minimize possible double-counting with the green card nominees, that 5,000 number should be reduced to 4,000. If one-quarter of those Chinese green card immigrants have left the company, then 3,000 are still at Amazon.",
            "The federal government also allows companies to hire foreign graduates who get work permits via the Occupational Practical Training program.",
            "In 2019, the federal government reported 478,732 Chinese students in the United States.",
            "In 2018, 25,843 Chinese graduates got work-permits via the \u2018STEM\u2019 side of the Optional Training Program, alongside 70,521 Indians and 17,000 graduates from other countries. That means Chinese provide a little more than a fifth, or 22 percent, of the overall STEM-OPT population \u2014 many of whom are invited by friendly managers into good jobs at prestigious companies.",
            "In 2018, Amazon employed 2,911 STEM-OPT graduates, suggesting a Chinese population of roughly 600 graduates.",
            "Amazon also hired 851 graduates with ordinary OPT work-permits and 691 foreign students with \u201cCurricular Practical Training\u201d work permits. The numbers may add another 300 Chinese employees to Amazon\u2019s ranks because Chinese students comprise almost one-third of all foreign graduates and students.",
            "So a back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests Amazon employs 2,500 Chinese-born people who have been nominated for green cards, 3,000 Chinese visa-workers with H-1Bs visas, and roughly 900 Chinese-born graduates with STEM-OPT, OPT, or CPT work-permits.",
            "That population adds up to 6,400 Chinese-born employees \u2014 nearly all of whom have parents and relatives back in China.",
            "Microsoft also has many Chinese-born employees in the United States.",
            "Microsoft has nominated roughly 3,400 Chinese citizens for green cards since 2010.\u00a0In 2018, it\u00a0employed 690 STEM-OPT graduates, 243 OPT workers, and 580 CPT workers. The company asked for 394 new H-1B workers in 2019, 1,509 in 2018, and 1,515 in 2017. It sought another 10,400 H-1B visa extensions and modifications since 2017.",
            "Once adjusted by the same low ball fractions as in the Amazon calculation, the federal data suggests Microsoft employs at least 6,000 Chinese-born employees.",
            "\u201cBased on the evaluation of risk communicated by global health authorities we have advised employees in China to work from home and cancel all non-essential business travel,\u201d a Microsoft employee told\u00a0Forbes.",

            "\u201cGiven the proper capabilities and technology of our producers, certainly, we enjoy the power to meet the country\u2019s needs and we can even produce more than the country\u2019s needs,\u201d the spokesman insisted, citing conversations with Iran\u2019s major manufacturers of hospital equipment. He claimed that Iran had shipped 700,000 sanitary packs nationwide already. Experts have recommended widespread use of sanitary masks in public and, in hospitals, extensive disinfectants and protective gear for health professionals, who are the most vulnerable to catch the infection.",
            "Rouhani, state media reported, emphasized the need for Iranians not to change their work patterns or behave irregularly. While prohibiting \u201cunnecessary gatherings,\u201d Rouhani vowed \u201cno lockdowns\u201d in the manner that China has implemented them, in which millions of people in entire cities cannot leave their homes save for an occasional, government-approved visit to a local grocer for basic food supplies.",
            "\u201cAt schools, high schools, universities and workplaces, everyone should pay attention to health recommendations, but we must all continue our work and activities,\u201d Rouhani insisted.",
            "Rouhani said that Iran would \u201creturn to normal on Saturday,\u201d without specifying why he expected the outbreak to be over so soon and so definitively. That assertion followed a declaration by Iranian Health Minister Saeed Namaki on Tuesday that the number of documented coronavirus cases in Qom, where the first coronavirus cases were initially confirmed, was growing. Namaki also said that the \u201cnumber of patients discharged has increased,\u201d suggesting that many are recovering swiftly. While the WHO documents \u201crecovered\u201d coronavirus cases, there is no guaranteed that those identified as such are not contagious or will not relapse. In China, Wuhan officials have been forced to re-quarantine individuals previously declared \u201ccured.\u201d",
            "Rouhani then shifted gears to attacking the United States for enduring regular seasons of influenza infections.",
            "The president \u201csaid that the U.S. and\u00a0other enemies have been attempting over the past 21 months to halt economic activities in Iran and make the people suffer through sanctions and propaganda campaigns,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency, which quoted Rouhani as saying that Washington is seeking to turn coronavirus into a \u201cweapon for the enemies.\u201d",
            "Condemning the United States, Rouhani said, \u201cThey themselves are afflicted with the coronavirus over there. They themselves lost 16,000 people to the flu, but do not make any references to it.\u201d",
            "Like in China, where state propaganda outlets have repeatedly denounced alleged American \u201cracism\u201d in handling coronavirus, Iranian state media has also claimed that there is a \u201cmalignant\u201d campaign to smear Iran as irresponsible in handling the outbreak.",
            "\u201cBut a lot of negative coverage has been singularly directed at Iran. Foreign media is attempting to portray Iran\u2019s fight against the coronavirus as wavering, even picturing the apocalypse in those attempts,\u201d a column at the government outlet PressTV read. \u201cThat is a very novel form of propagating a phobia of Iran. In the past, Iran has been depicted as part of \u2018the axis of evil,\u2019 \u2018the world\u2019s chief state sponsor of terror,\u2019 and \u2018a pariah state with nuclear ambitions.'\u201d",
            "Rouhani made his remarks at the newly minted\u00a0National Headquarters to Fight against Coronavirus, where he is the head of the official task force to fight the virus. Rouhani replaced Iraj Harirchi, a deputy Health Ministry officials who appeared on television this week insisting the situation was under control shortly before announcing he himself at become infected with the virus.",
            "At press time, Iran claims to have confirmed 139 coronavirus cases and 19 virus-related deaths.",
