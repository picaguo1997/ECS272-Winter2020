            "This story was originally published on Tuesday. On Thursday, Dr. Li Wenliang was reported to be critically ill. Earlier in the day, state media said he had died.",
            " (CNN)On December 30, Li Wenliang dropped a bombshell in his medical school alumni group on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat: seven patients from a local seafood market had been diagnosed with a SARS-like illness and quarantined in his hospital. ",
            "Li explained that, according to a test he had seen, the illness was a coronavirus -- a large family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). ",
            "Memories of SARS run deep in China, where a pandemic in 2003 killed hundreds following a government cover up. \"I only wanted to remind my university classmates to be careful,\" he said.",
            "Li, a 34-year-old doctor working in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, told his friends to warn their loved ones privately. But within hours screenshots of his messages had gone viral -- without his name being blurred. \"When I saw them circulating online, I realized that it was out of my control and I would probably be punished,\" Li said.",
            "He was right.",
            "Soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumor-mongering by the Wuhan police. He was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak. The virus has since claimed at least 425 lives and sickened more than 20,000 people globally -- including Li.",
            "From an intensive care bed in hospital, Li told CNN he was confirmed Saturday to have contracted the virus.",
            "His diagnosis has sparked outrage across China, where a backlash is growing against state censorship around the illness and an initial delay in warning the public about the deadly virus.",
            "Summoned by the police ",
            "On the same day in December that Li messaged his friends, an emergency notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, informing the city's medical institutions that a series of patients from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market had an \"unknown pneumonia.\"",
            "The notice came with a warning: \"Any organizations or individuals are not allowed to release treatment information to the public without authorization.\" ",
            "In the early hours of December 31, Wuhan's health authorities held an emergency meeting to discuss the outbreak. Afterwards, Li was summoned by officials at his hospital to explain how he knew about the cases, according to state-run newspaper Beijing Youth Daily. ",
            "Later that day, the Wuhan authorities announced the outbreak and alerted the World Health Organization. But Li's troubles did not end there.   ",
            "On January 3, Li was called to a local police station and reprimanded for \"spreading rumors online\" and \"severely disrupting social order\" over the message he sent in the chat group. ",
            "In that message, Li said the patients had been diagnosed with SARS, citing the test result that showed the pathogen tested positive for the SARS virus with a high \"confidence coefficient\" -- a measure indicating the accuracy of the test. He clarified in a subsequent message that the virus was actually a different type of coronavirus, but the screenshot of his first message had already spread online.",
            "Li had to sign a statement -- which CNN has seen a photograph of -- acknowledging his \"misdemeanor\" and promising not to commit further \"unlawful acts.\"  ",
            "He feared he was going to be detained. \"My family would worry sick about me, if I lose my freedom for a few days,\" he told CNN over a text message on WeChat -- he was coughing too much and breathing too poorly to speak over the phone. ",
            "Luckily, Li was allowed to leave the police station after an hour. ",
            "The Wuhan police has not responded to CNN's request for comment at the time of publishing. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission declined to comment. ",
            "The ophthalmologist returned to work at Wuhan Central Hospital feeling helpless. He said: \"There was nothing I could do. (Everything) has to adhere to the official line.\" ",
            "On January 10, after unwittingly treating a patient with the Wuhan coronavirus, Li started coughing and developed a fever the next day. He was hospitalized on January 12. In the following days, Li's condition deteriorated so badly that he was admitted to the intensive care unit, and given oxygen support. ",
            "On February 1, he tested positive for coronavirus.",
            "Playing down the outbreak",
            "From the start, the Chinese authorities wanted to control information about the outbreak, silencing any voices that differed with their narrative -- regardless of whether they were telling the truth.",
            "On January 1, the Wuhan police announced it had \"taken legal measures\" against eight people who had recently \"published and shared rumors online\" about the pneumonia-like illness and \"caused adverse impacts on society.\"",
            "\"The internet is not a land beyond the law ... Any unlawful acts of fabricating, spreading rumors and disturbing the social order will be punished by police according to the law, with zero tolerance,\" said a police statement on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform.",
            "The police announcement was broadcast across the country on CCTV, China's state broadcaster, making it clear how the Chinese government would treat such \"rumormongers.\"",
            "In the two weeks that followed, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission remained the only source for updates on the developments of the outbreak. Chinese scientists identified the pathogen as a new coronavirus on January 7. For about a week, no new confirmed cases were announced. Health authorities maintained there was \"no obvious evidence for human to human transmission,\" no infection of healthcare workers, and that the outbreak was \"preventable and controllable.\" ",
            "On January 31, Li wrote in a post on Weibo how he felt during that period: \"I was wondering why (the government's) official notices were still saying there was no human-to-human transmission, and there were no healthcare workers infected.\"  ",
            "Then came a sudden jump in infections. Until January 17, the Wuhan authorities had only reported 41 cases of the virus. By January 20, that number had soared to 198.",
            "The central government took over and, on January 20, President Xi Jinping ordered \"resolute efforts to curb the spread\" of the coronavirus and stressed the need for the timely release of information -- it was the first time Xi had publicly addressed the outbreak. ",
            "Later that evening, Zhong Nanshan, a government-appointed respiratory expert, known for fighting SARS 17 years ago, declared on state broadcaster CCTV that the new coronavirus was transmissible from person to person.  ",
            "Three days later, authorities placed an unprecedented lockdown on Wuhan, the economic engine and transportation hub of China's central heartland -- but five million people had already left the city for the Lunar New Year holiday.",
            "Now, the virus has spread to every region in the country, including the far western frontier of Xinjiang and the remote region of Tibet.",
            "In an interview with CCTV on January 27, Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted his government did not disclose information on the coronavirus \"in a timely fashion.\"",
            "He explained that under Chinese law on infectious diseases, the local government first needs to report the outbreak to national health authorities, and then get approval from the State Council before making an announcement.",
            "\"For the late disclosure, I hope everyone can understand that this is an infectious disease, and relevant information has special channels to be disclosed in accordance with law,\" he said.",
            "Public uproar",
            "By late January, the Wuhan government's mishandling of the outbreak was becoming well-understood in China. Many online thought of the group of eight \"rumormongers,\" saying their early warnings could have saved hundreds of lives. ",
            "Calls for the eight to be vindicated grew -- even in state media. Xi's call for the timely release of information was seen as a green light to report on the coronavirus and Chinese journalists began producing in-depth coverage and hard-hitting investigative reports. The state-run newspaper Beijing Youth Daily interviewed Li and the article went viral. The piece was censored within hours, but the uproar remained.",
            "As public anger mounted, China's Supreme Court on January 28 criticized the Wuhan police for punishing the \"rumormongers.\" ",
            "\"It might have been a fortunate thing for containing the new coronavirus, if the public had listened to this 'rumor' at the time, and adopted measures such as wearing masks, strict disinfection and avoiding going to the wildlife market,\" the Supreme Court commentary said.",
            "Bowing to pressure, the Wuhan police issued a statement the next day, saying the eight people had only committed \"particularly minor\" misdemeanors for spreading \"unverified information.\" It said they had only been summoned for a talk and not detained or fined.",
            "On Saturday, another \"rumormonger\" came forward with her story in the Chinese press. ",
            "Xie Linka, an oncologist at Wuhan Union Hospital, told Chinese media she received a warning from police after sending an alert to her colleagues in a WeChat group on the evening of December 30. ",
            "In the message, Xie relayed a warning from fellow doctors about an infectious disease: \"Don't go to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the near future. Several people were found to have contracted an unknown pneumonia similar to SARS there. Today our hospital has received multiple patients from the market. Everyone please remember to wear masks and ventilate properly.\"",
            "Now recovering in a quarantine ward, Li said he was not sure if he was one of the eight \"rumormongers.\" But he felt relieved after reading the Supreme Court commentary, taking it as a sign that the central government is against giving him a harsh punishment.  ",
            "On Li's Weibo, tens of thousands have left comments thanking him for speaking out and wishing him a speedy discovery.",
            "\"Dr Li, you're a good doctor with conscience. I hope you stay safe and sound,\" read one of the top-rated comments.",
            "Others have questioned what could have been if Li's warning had been heeded.",
            "\"If Wuhan had paid attention to [his warning] back then and taken active preventive measures,\" wrote another Weibo user, \"where we stand now a month later could be a completely different picture.\"",

            "More than 3,700 passengers and crew are stuck on the cruise ship in Yokohama that became a floating quarantine zone after dozens of people tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month.",
            "The cruise ship has the largest outbreak of the virus outside of mainland China, with the number of infections continuing to increase day by day. On Wednesday, Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato announced 40 new cases among those on board.",
            "To date, a total of 175 people aboard the Diamond Princess have become infected. But while those confirmed to have the virus have been sent to local hospitals, the remaining passengers and crew have been in quarantine on the ship since February 4. ",
            "Media attention has so far focused on the ship's international passengers who paid thousands of dollars for the cruise and are now confined to their rooms. The quarantine, which is scheduled to end on February 19, has led to cabin fever among many -- with passengers only allowed out on deck for a limited time. ",
            "But as the quarantine continues more than 1,000 crew members remain at work, providing for and interacting with potentially infected passengers and taking care of the ship. They work wearing their uniforms, masks and gloves.",

            "In a statement posted on their site, Princess Cruises said that, all crew members who have been cleared after an initial health screening by the Japanese Ministry of Health are \"fulfilling their duties as required\" and additional crew testing by health officials is ongoing. \"When not working, crew members are requested to be in their staterooms,\" said the statement.",

            "The patient -- a 35-year-old resident of Snohomish County, Washington, with no history of major health problems -- had returned from visiting family in Wuhan on January 15. He had not visited the seafood market where a number of early patients were initially linked, nor did he have any known contacts with sick people during his visit. ",
            "Still, the man had seen a health alert by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and decided to visit an urgent care clinic on January 19, at which point he had been coughing for four days. ",
            "Doctors initially found nothing abnormal on chest X-rays, but sent swabs to the CDC because of his recent travel to Wuhan. By the following day, on January 20, they confirmed the man had the novel coronavirus.",
            "At that point, the man was admitted to Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, and placed in an airborne-isolation unit. Throughout his illness, he experienced a range of symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and runny nose.",
            "But it wasn't until his fifth day in the hospital -- day nine of his illness -- that doctors saw signs of pneumonia on his chest X-ray, in the lower lobe of his left lung. On the following day, his chest X-ray showed \"stable streaky opacities in the lung bases ... indicating likely atypical pneumonia.\"",
            "On his eighth day in the hospital, his condition improved. As of January 30, he no longer had a fever, and his symptoms were gone except for his cough, which was \"decreasing in severity,\" the doctors wrote. Officials are monitoring close contacts in the US but have not found evidence he transmitted the virus to anyone else.",

            "Li was among a number of supposed \"rumormongers\" detained in December for spreading news about the virus. He had warned  about a potential \"SARS-like\" virus spreading in Wuhan.

            "Hong Kong (CNN Business)Months of increasingly violent protests and a bruising US-China trade war pushed Hong Kong into a recession last year for the first time in a decade. Now the coronavirus outbreak threatens to derail things once again.",
            "Officials on Monday said Hong Kong's economy shrank 1.2% last year as massive pro-democracy protests paralyzed the city's streets and scared away tourists. GDP shrank 2.9% in the fourth quarter alone. The trade spat between Washington and Beijing compounded the problem, as did concerns about China's economic growth. ",
            "Until recently, the Asian financial hub had reason to hope that 2020 would be better. The demonstrations were becoming less frequent, while an initial trade deal provided some hope that the relationship between the United States and China could improve. ",
            "\"The US-China phase one trade deal and growth stabilization in China should have been positive for Hong Kong's near-term economic outlook,\" said Tommy Wu, a senior economist at Oxford Economics. \"But it has been overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak.\"",
            "Hong Kong now has to worry about how to stave off a dangerous epidemic that spurred government officials to cancel school for weeks, order civil servants to work from home and urge private companies to do the same. Retail stores, theme parks, cultural attractions and other hotspots also remain closed. Crowds are still common, but most people are wearing face masks as a form of protection.",
            "The coronavirus \"will definitely cause a double blow to the economy,\" Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a Sunday blog post. He added that the virus \"will greatly increase the risk of continued economic contraction this year.\"",
            "The Hong Kong government said Monday that the city's economic outlook this year is \"subject to high uncertainties,\" including the global economy, trade and the protests. As for the coronavirus outbreak, the government said it would \"monitor the situation closely.\"",
            "Hong Kong, which has some level of autonomy from mainland China and its own immigration system, has managed to avoid the worst of the outbreak. Only 15 cases have been confirmed in the city, and there have been no deaths. Just over the border in mainland China, the number of confirmed cases totals more than 17,000, while at least 360 people have died. ",
            "But the memory of 2003's SARS crisis looms large in Hong Kong, reminding its people of the toll a serious disease can take on the city. More than 280 of the 774 people who died from SARS were reported in Hong Kong, the highest death toll outside of mainland China. The SARS scare caused the city's economy to shrink 0.5% in the second quarter before it rebounded later in the year.",
            "A 'double whammy' for businesses",
            "Last year's protest movement led millions of Hong Kongers to take to the streets and demand democratic and police reforms. Some clashes between protesters and police became violent, and tear gas, petrol bombs, rubber bullets and water cannons became part of the city's new normal. ",
            "The protests hit the city's hospitality and food and beverage industries particularly hard. Many people just stopped going out, fearful that if they strayed too far from home they would find themselves accidentally caught up in a demonstration or cut off from public transportation.",
            "Despite the turmoil, the hospitality industry had been showing signs of recovery in December, according to Allan Zeman, the founder of the property developer Lan Kwai Fong Group.",
            "\"It's kind of a double whammy for Hong Kong,\" said Zeman, whose company developed the popular Hong Kong nightlife district Lan Kwai Fong. ",
            "\"We were hoping that going into the Year of the Rat that this would continue,\" he added, referring to this year's Lunar New Year zodiac. \"Suddenly, the coronavirus hit.\" ",
            "Black Sheep Restaurants, a group that runs more than 20 Hong Kong businesses, echoed that show of progress, along with concerns about the virus. ",
            "\"Things were on the up at the end of last year and first couple of weeks of [January],\" Co-founder Syed Asim Hussain told CNN Business in an email. \"However we are now again between a rock and a hard place.\"",
            "Hussain said the company's main concern is the safety of its team. But he added that Black Sheep expects February to be slow, potentially leading to a \"financial write off\" for the first quarter.",
            "Tourism is another major concern for the city. The protests already took a heavy toll on the industry: The number of people who visited Hong Kong in November plunged by nearly half compared to a year earlier, according to the latest available government figures. ",
            "The coronavirus outbreak will likely exacerbate that problem. Most of Hong Kong's visitors come from mainland China, where many cities have placed their residents on lockdown. Hong Kong has also closed some of its border crossings into the mainland in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. ",
            "Too early to tell",
            "What's still uncertain is how dramatic and long lasting the effects of the coronavirus will be on Hong Kong's economy.",
            "Iris Pang, an economist at ING, told CNN Business that she expects retail to be moderately affected by the outbreak, noting that last year's protests caused those businesses to take a big hit. But she added that ING doesn't think the virus will have a substantial impact on GDP. ",
            "Goldman Sachs on Friday cut its forecast for Hong Kong's economic growth in the first quarter from 5.6% to 4%. The analysts attributed that in large part to how the virus will impact the city's tourism, retail, hospitality, and food and beverage industries.",
            "The bank warned that things could get worse, and that a prolonged outbreak could lower full-year economic growth to 5% or less.",
            "Wu, of Oxford Economics, said the virus could have a \"drastic\" impact on the economy. ",
            "\"Some sectors are doing better \u2014 like supermarkets, drugstores etc. But shopping malls and luxury brands will likely be hit badly,\" he said. ",
            "Wu added that the problem isn't just about the lack of tourism in the city, but about how much people who already live in Hong Kong will spend as worries about the spread of the virus grow. ",
            "Zeman, of Lan Kwai Fong, the said it's too early to tell how bad the effects will be, since a lot of businesses are just now getting back to work after the Lunar New Year. The holiday ended last Wednesday, but many in the city typically take the whole week off. ",
            "But the government-mandated closures of schools and some public facilities, along with official encouragement that people stay indoors, will likely mean an uncertain future for many businesses.",
            "\"It's not an easy situation, because at the moment, there's no light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Zeman. \"I know many of my tenants, I don't know if they can survive.\"",

            "Authorities said the Wuhan coronavirus was passed from animals to humans; can be spread from person to person; and appears to cause pneumonia in people who have weakened immune systems.  ",
            "It is thought to be milder that SARS and MERS and take longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit a hospital.",

            "Scientists in China say that the virus might have jumped from bats to snakes, which were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, and then to humans.",
            "However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery, and further tests are necessary to determine the source animal.",
            "At least 30 people died in the province, many of them elderly and suffering from pre-existing conditions.",
            "As deaths mount in the city, officials imposed a number of new measures including the postponement of New Year celebrations in Wuhan, a ban on tour agencies from bringing groups of people out of the city and thermal monitors and screening in public spaces.  ",

Follow him on Twitter @WorldAffairsPro. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his; view more opinions on CNN.",
            " (CNN)As the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread around the world, the World Health Organization's decision to hold off on declaring the outbreak \"a public health emergency of international concern\" is baffling.",
            "The virus, which is similar to the fatal severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), first emerged in Wuhan, China, which has a population greater than New York City. More than 1,900 people have already been infected, and more than 55 people have died. To contain the virus during the Lunar New Year, which marks the largest annual human migration in the world, the Chinese government placed a lockdown on 12 cities, affecting about 35 million people. On Saturday, China said it would halt all outbound international tour groups starting Monday. ",
            "Although authorities in Wuhan initially cracked down on people accused of spreading \"rumors\" about the illness, the Chinese government has since taken rapid and strict measures to contain the virus. Their efforts are laudable but may not be sufficient given the movement of people who may have been infected in the weeks before the lockdown was ordered. ",
            "While Chinese officials have a responsibility to limit the spread of the outbreak, global health officials in Geneva need to take quick action. By declaring a global emergency, WHO would set in motion coordination efforts among various countries and encourage UN member states to institute strict surveillance measures. While some initial panic could result, WHO's leadership would jolt passive governments into action.",
            "In making its decision not to declare a global public health emergency, WHO officials cited a limited number of cases abroad, and strong, preventative containment measures in China. \"While this outbreak is an emergency in China, it has not yet become a global health emergency,\" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told me.",
            "However, the number of overseas cases are growing rapidly. There are more than 35 cases in more than a dozen countries and territories outside mainland China, including two in the United States. On Friday, the first European cases were confirmed in France. As for the number of cases in China, some experts suggest the total could be far higher than what is currently being reported. ",
            "By WHO's own definition, an international public health emergency is \"an extraordinary event which is determined ... to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.\" Given what we've seen of the Wuhan coronavirus so far, the threshold for the declaration has surely been met.",
            "In a public statement, the organization said, \"the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should be reconvened in a matter of days to examine the situation further.\"",
            "In a 2018 report analyzing the responses to the earlier Ebola, Zika and H1N1 public health emergencies, public health researchers Steven Hoffman and Sarah Silverberg wrote, \"When the systems for recognizing and responding to disease outbreaks act too slowly, the result is unnecessary delay, greater disease spread, additional people affected, and more lives lost.\"",
            "The WHO, a mainline UN agency which is heavily influenced by members states, has used the international public health emergency declaration sparingly, has come under fire for being too slow to act. We saw that when WHO finally declared Ebola a public health emergency of international concern in 2014, eight months after the outbreak first emerged. By that time, the outbreak had already spread to three countries, and the virus ultimately killed more than 11,000 people. ",
            "\"Ebola exposed WHO as unable to meet its responsibility for responding to such situations and alerting the global community,\" said an independent panel of experts in 2015 that included members from the Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",
            "The panel went further, suggesting the establishment of a new global health committee within the UN Security Council to declare outbreaks and international emergencies for more timely responses.",
            "A perfect storm for authorities in Beijing?",
            "Placing cities on lockdown, especially when tens of millions of Chinese people planned to travel and celebrate the Lunar New Year holidays, has already sparked panic and created a headache for the Chinese Communist Party. Long lines have been reported at local hospitals, tourist attractions like the Forbidden City in Beijing and Shanghai Disneyland have been closed, and large public gatherings are now forbidden around China. Public criticism of authorities has increased dramatically on social media, although many of the posts were later taken down.",
            "What happens next in terms of public reaction may be of a magnitude not seen by Beijing authorities for some time. After all, far more minor events have sparked protests in China \u2014 including protests over a waste incineration plant near Wuhan last year in which riot police had to be deployed. ",
            "Let's be clear. The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading rapidly, including to other continents outside of Asia. There is no known vaccine. Tens of millions of people who live in China or recently traveled to the Hubei province are still on the move. ",
            "In the absence of a declaration of a global public health emergency, governments or regional bodies such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are free to coordinate action themselves. ",
            "Out of an abundance of caution, the UN should act immediately to raise the international alarm to prevent further infections and deaths. So far, cities like Vancouver, which has an international airport hosting numerous Chinese airlines,  haven't instituted thermal screening for incoming passengers. In Toronto, Ontario's chief medical officer of health announced on Saturday the first \"presumptive\" case of the coronavirus in Canada. ",
            "While the declaration of a global public health emergency could stoke widespread fear and would by no means bring the outbreak under control, it will push countries around the world to take preventative action and encourage them to step up surveillance. If there is one thing that we have learned from previous outbreaks, viruses do not respect borders and thrive when there is a lack of urgent and coordinated human action. Time is of the essence.",

            "Hong Kong (CNN Business)The small companies that drive China's economy are worried about how much damage the novel coronavirus outbreak will cause. Without help or a reprieve from the disease, many may have only weeks to survive. ",
            "While some larger companies are reopening their doors after weeks of lockdowns designed to contain the epidemic, small businesses often can't comply with the strict health rules now required in many regions and many don't have the option of letting employees work from home.",
            "A survey of 163 companies of all sizes across China found that less than half were able to get back to work this week, according to investment bank China International Capital Corp, which published the results. Even more alarming: A third of roughly 1,000 small and medium-sized companies surveyed by academics from Tsinghua University and Peking University last week said they could only survive for a month with the cash they have. ",
            "That could spell terrible news for China's entrepreneurs \u2014 and an even worse reality for the country's economy. About 30 million small and medium-sized businesses contribute more than 60% of the country's GDP, according to government statistics published last September. The taxes they pay account for more than half of government revenue, and they employ more than 80% of China's workers.",
            "It's not clear how many of those companies will ultimately feel the full impact of the virus. Surveys cover only a tiny slice of the sector, and the full extent of the outbreak's consequences are still impossible to determine. But many small companies were already struggling before the coronavirus began infecting tens of thousands across the country. The world's second largest economy has been slowing down due to a combination of rising debt, a slump in domestic demand and a trade war with the United States. Now they face going without business for weeks on end. ",
            "\"The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the camel's back,\" wrote Zhao Jian, director of the Shandong province-based Atlantis Research Institute in a research note earlier this month. He warned that if the outbreak doesn't end soon, unemployment will likely rise as businesses shut down \u2014 a problem Beijing had been fighting hard this year to prevent. Job losses could spur a tide of housing foreclosures, Zhao added, compounding the country's economic woes.",
            "'We will die' without more money",
            "Some business owners have gone public with their plight. Beijing entrepreneur Wu Hai wrote on social media app WeChat this week that the outbreak could destroy more than 50 karaoke bars he runs across the country. The pastime has been halted as the government maintains a shutdown of popular entertainment spots where \"cross infection risks\" are high.",
            "In the post, Wu lamented the closures and said the lack of business puts his 1,500 workers at risk of losing their jobs. He wrote that his company, MeiKTV, has about 12 million yuan ($1.7 million) in cash on hand, giving it about two months to survive if he's unable to reopen for business. ",
            "\"That means we will die in April unless investors continue to give us money,\" he wrote.",
            "Shu Congxuan, chairman of Home Original Chicken, said last Saturday that his fast food chain has shut more than 400 stores since the outbreak began. In a Weibo post, he warned that his company is in danger of running out of cash, since it still needs to pay rent and employees. But he said he would try to make sure his employees keep their jobs, even if he needs to sell his houses and cars.",
            "Other companies appear to be taking desperate measures to recoup at least some of their losses. Beijing-based Meizhou Dongpo Restaurant said on Weibo that its employees have set up stalls to sell fresh vegetables on the street. While the company did not elaborate on the reason for its decision, a local government-run newspaper reported that the restaurant had purchased fresh produce for the Lunar New Year holiday season, but was unable to use it because of the outbreak. ",
            "The outcome for many businesses could be dire if the situation does not improve rapidly. According to the Tsinghua University and Peking University survey of firms, 85% of respondents said they would go out of business if the outbreak lasts three months. By the six month mark, 90% of the companies would collapse. ",
            "Even a recovery in the near future may not come soon enough for some. Before the outbreak, Chinese companies were preparing to pay back or refinance a lot of debt this year, according to analysts at S&P Global Ratings. Given the rising risk to the economy, they may find it harder to borrow.",
            "The S&P researchers warned in a note this week that if the public health crisis stabilizes next month, liquidity will still be under pressure through at least the first half of the year. They added that the outbreak will also heighten the risk of default for Chinese companies. ",
            "Government may need to do more ",
            "Beijing already knows that it has a major problem on its hands. Before the outbreak, senior officials had characterized the prevention of mass unemployment as their top priority for 2020. Now that the likelihood of mass job losses is increasing, the country is going all out to stop it from happening.",
            "Some of the most prominent companies in China, for example, are taking in workers displaced by the outbreak. JD.com (JD), one of China's largest e-commerce firms, earlier this week promised to open up more than 20,000 new positions. Alibaba (BABA) announced a similar plan.",
            "The government is also stepping in. Last week, the People's Bank of China pumped billions of dollars into the money market to shore up banks' ability to lend money. The central bank also set up a 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) special fund to provide cheap loans to key companies in epidemic prevention. Meanwhile, the finance ministry announced government subsidies to make those loans even cheaper.",
            "Local governments in Beijing, Shanghai and several provinces have also rolled out targeted measures to help small businesses, including offering subsidies to landlords so they can reduce rents, and allowing small companies to delay the payment of social security contributions or taxes.",
            "But it's not clear how helpful some of those policies will be.",
            "Wu, the karaoke bar owner, wrote in his WeChat post that he felt his company was still at a \"dead end\" even with the policies offered to him. Social security, for example, is still a major expense for employers. Wu suggested that simply delaying those payments would not really help. ",
            "\"Social Security Bureau, how generous you are,\" Wu commented sarcastically. \"Our employees are going to lose jobs. The company is going to collapse. You not only don't want to take some money out, but you still want to collect money from us \u2014 not even a penny less!\"",
            "Wu did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business. But in his WeChat post he also criticized the usefulness of giving subsidies to landlords. While he said the policy is \"well intended,\" he questioned whether landlords would actually reduce the amount their tenants pay. ",
            "He also doubted the effectiveness of preferential loans set up by the central bank. ",
            "\"We have no fixed assets as collateral. We have no operating cash flows \u2014 because we can't open for business \u2014 as collateral,\" Wu wrote. \"Tell me, which small and medium-sized company can get the bank funding?\"",

By New Year's Eve, it was obvious something akin to SARS -- as it turns out, the Wuhan coronavirus is in the same family of viruses as SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) -- was unfolding in China.",
            "The mysterious pneumonia virus that emerged from a live animal market in China's central city of Wuhan last month has now infected far too many people, over far too vast a geographic area, to be easily controlled.",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus -- part of a family of viruses that are common among animals and can cause fever as well as respiratory symptoms when transmitted to humans -- has been found in cities all over China, and travelers have since spread the virus to several countries, including Singapore, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea as well as Hong Kong and Macau.",
            "The first American case -- involving a man in his 30s who recently traveled to Wuhan -- was confirmed outside Seattle on January 21, before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Friday a second case in Chicago. As of Friday, at least 41 people have died from the illness.",
            "I warned that China appeared to be taking more aggressive steps shutting down social media posts, arresting people accused of spreading \"rumors\" and capping the flow of information about the outbreak than it was halting the transmission of the virus. For more than a week, the reported number of cases barely changed after local authorities shut down the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, the putative source of the virus. And authorities insisted the cause was neither SARS, nor similar viruses like the flu, avian flu, or MERS.",
            "They also repeatedly stated that there was no evidence of human-to-human spread of the disease (which turned out to be false), leading the World Health Organization and outside world to believe that closing the live animal market effectively brought the outbreak to a halt.",
            "As recently as January 18, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention posted stern warnings against paying heed to \"rumors\" and insisted there were no cases of the disease in hospitals outside of Wuhan, adding that the outbreak was \"preventable and controllable.\"",
            "But we now know that was far from true.",
            "Officially, there are more than 1,000 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus. Unofficially, however, the toll is likely to be far higher, and more than 20 Chinese cities have reported cases of the coronavirus. ",
            "Separate studies from London's Imperial College and Hong Kong University Medical School estimated that some 1,300 to 1,700 people were infected during the first week of January, when Chinese officials reported just a handful of cases and downplayed the epidemic's severity. This week, the Imperial College team estimated that there were a total of 4,000 cases (with the possibility of up to 9,700 cases in the worst-case scenario) by January 18, when the official tally was still at 62 cases.",
            "Using a different statistical method, scientists at Northeastern University in Boston reckon that 5,900 were infected by January 23.",
            "Despite the wide disparity in the figures, this new epidemic seems poised to eclipse the scale of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and is already well outside of the reach of simple control measures.",
            "Hong Kong University virologist Guan Yi, who was part of the team that discovered the SARS virus, tells the Washington Post that the epidemic is so out of control now that \"a bigger outbreak is certain.\" He said that even with a conservative estimate, the outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic -- with a reach of more than 80,000 cases.",
            "Speaking on background, other SARS veterans tell me there may already be \"many thousands\" of infected individuals in China.",
            "Because authorities initially downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak instead of implementing swift control measures, people have traveled to and from Wuhan -- a major transportation hub with a population of 11 million people -- and unwittingly carried the virus with them.",
            "Chinese authorities have shut down flights, ferries, highways, and trains leaving Wuhan, as well as public transportation within the city. Twelve other cities in China have issued travel restrictions in an unprecedented move to contain the virus just days before the Lunar New Year on January 25, which usually ushers the largest human migration on earth, with hundreds of millions of people traveling to see relatives.",
            "Following my January 8 claim that the Chinese government was covering up a significant epidemic, pressure mounted from United Nations agencies, Ministries of Health worldwide and the scientific community. Finally, Wuhan provincial communist party chief Jiang Chaoliang, and his counterparts in neighboring districts, came under veiled criticism from President Xi Jinping who ordered Party leaders to \"put people's safety and health as the top priority and take effective measures to curb the spread of the virus.\"",
            "On January 20, China's National Health Commission designated the new disease a Class B infection, although it was treating the virus as a Class A infection -- meaning mandatory quarantines and community lockdowns may be used to stop its spread.",
            "And the following day, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission posted on social media that, \"Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people.\" The commentary also warned that \"anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity\" and stressed that transparency was the best defense against rumors and widespread fear.",
            "Not surprisingly, reported numbers of cases from all over China jumped dramatically after Xi's speech and subsequent pressure from Beijing. This has confused matters considerably, making it impossible to tell how much of the soaring epidemic toll is due to a surge in actual new infections, versus release of case numbers that local authorities had been covering up.",
            "Worse, despite calls for openness, SARS hero Dr. Zhong Nanshan, who was celebrated for his 2003 efforts, gave a televised interview on January 20 in which he warned that 14 healthcare workers were infected in Wuhan, the risk to medical personnel is acute, and severity of threat will rise if the virus mutates. Zhong, who had initially made several appearances on Chinese television, has not been featured on broadcasts in recent days, with some speculating that the government is now silencing him. ",
            "But Zhong's warning represented sound science. As the leading Chinese virology team wrote, after comparing the genetics and proteins of the new virus and SARS, \"the Wuhan nCoV poses a significant public health risk for human transmission,\"  because it -- like SARS -- has the ability to bind to a protein found on the surface of most human lung cells. \"People also need to be reminded that risk and dynamic of cross-species or human-to-human transmission of coronaviruses are also affected by many other factors,\" like the host's immune response, the speed with which the viruses can multiply inside human lungs, and the potential mutations that might make the virus more virulent or transmissible. ",
            "Regardless of how transparent Beijing may now become, what I witnessed tracking SARS across Hong Kong and China, and subsequent investigations of sites hit by the disease in Hanoi, Bangkok, Singapore, Toronto and Hong Kong augurs poorly for this new viral epidemic and China's ability to bring it to a rapid resolution.",
            "While 17 years has brought significant improvements in virology, diagnostics development, international health regulations and the WHO, and we know more today about the nCoV2019 virus (as the Wuhan coronavirus is awkwardly dubbed) than we did one month into the SARS epidemic, there is no magic wand that can wave this highly dispersed, airborne-spread, human-to-human transmitting microbe away.",
            "After the initial coverup, Beijing is now executing the playbook that ultimately stopped SARS. The city of Wuhan is now on lockdown and fever checkpoints are operating in most major transit hubs across the country while Lunar New Year celebrations have been canceled. Instant contagious quarantine 1,000-bed facilities are under construction, with one due to open next week outside Wuhan. One key step -- closing all live animal markets nationwide -- has not yet been implemented.",
            "I discovered in 2003 that wildlife dealers and animal breeders sell their living creatures all over the country, so that an infected animal in one city's market may well have a counterpart from the same dealer, on sale in another market hundreds of miles away. It is not yet known what beast was the source of nCoV2019, though one study suggests, based on genetic analysis of the virus, that it came from a snake. The SARS virus was transmitted to restaurant workers who bought and slaughtered live civets -- raccoon-like animals in a Guangzhou live animal market, which I investigated before authorities shut it down.",
            "Like the Guangzhou market, Wuhan's Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market sells a vast range of animals, including civets as well as other exotic wild animals. All live animal markets throughout China and neighboring Asian countries should be shut down immediately, and not reopen until the source of the nCoV2019 epidemic is identified. Until then, it should be assumed that any live animals sold in markets from Hanoi, Vietnam, to Ulan Bator, Mongolia, might be dangerous to hold, slaughter or consume.",
            "To stop the SARS epidemic in 2003, governments, hospitals and public health authorities resorted to measures that mirrored infection control in the early 20th century, focusing on taking temperatures to find individuals with fevers, and then placing those people -- regardless of the causes of their febrile states -- in mandatory quarantine. Eventually, with the feverish souls separated from the rest of humanity, the virus stopped spreading. By June 2003 the Chinese government was able to declare victory over SARS, eight months after the virus first emerged. ",
            "Here is what it will take, then, to stop the Wuhan virus.",
            "First, the flow of people who are infected has to stop and transportation across the entirety of China must be monitored or restricted. The Wuhan animal market from which nCoV2019 arose is located less than 0.5 miles from one of the city's train stations, where several high-speed rails stop. It must be assumed that people, and their live animals, walked that short distance earlier this month to take the trains -- possibly carrying the virus with them to cities across China.",
            "A post from Wuhan Railway that has since been deleted said 300,000 people traveled out of  Wuhan by train on Wednesday. It is imperative that the tough lockdown measures unfolding this week presage nationwide travel restrictions.",
            "During the SARS epidemic, a brave military physician leaked medical documents to Time magazine, providing proof that SARS patients were secretly being treated in People's Liberation Army facilities in Beijing. Once word was out, I watched as tens of thousands of Beijing residents climbed onto trains, fleeing the city -- and taking SARS to every corner of the country.",
            "After the exodus from Beijing in 2003, authorities erected fever check stations in every air, bus and train terminal in China, and placed policed health stations along the nation's highways. Fever-check stations were so abundant that I was typically tested 10 to 12 times a day in Beijing, and every 10 to 20 miles while driving on major highways.",
            "The Chinese government has started erecting a network of fever stations in transit hubs, and I expect this will ramp up considerably over the coming week. Social media posts already show several photos and videos of officials erecting roadblocks, barricades, and traffic diversions to police-manned fever stations and similar measures reminiscent of what I witnessed in 2003.",
            "Currently, family members of known nCoV2019 patients are tested for infection and placed under surveillance. Chinese authorities are already tracking hundreds of close contacts of known patients, and this will escalate radically over coming days. Apartment complexes and hotels that are known to have housed a nCoV2019-infected person will also be scoured.",
            "There must also be a safe place to quarantine people who are running temperatures. In 2003 I watched in frank astonishment as teams of Chinese workers erected entire hospitals -- complete with air filters, special sewage systems and electricity -- in just days, province-by-province. A similar effort is now underway in Wuhan.",
            "By far the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. Both MERS and SARS spread like wildfire through unprepared medical facilities, regardless of the comparative wealth and sophistication of the hospitals. Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: one had just a single healthcare worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments.",
            "The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training, which taught staff to work in teams and make sure that any contaminated protective gear was safely removed without contact with the skin, face, eyes or hands.",
            "Over the last few days, many Chinese social media users have posted dramatic videos and photos of over-crowded hospital emergency room facilities, in which frantic patients and family members are crammed together and healthcare workers are hard-pressed to control the influx, as the infectious spread of the virus is surely occurring. In the SARS epidemic, hospitals eventually realized the need to set up fever check stations outside the facilities, screening would-be patients, and ushering febrile individuals into an entry separate from other hospital admissions.",
            "In Toronto and Singapore, which have remarkably good healthcare systems and state-of-the-art facilities, hospital workers struggled mightily to stop spread of SARS, and healthcare workers who were infected died. In some of my discussions with physicians and nurses that went through the SARS nightmares, I have learned that the wealthier facilities were, perhaps, at greater risk because they had more equipment and procedures to apply to patients, including intubation and lavage, which was used to remove  fluids from the lungs that built up in response to infection.",
            "When SARS hit Hanoi, patients were originally taken to the prestigious French Hospital, where modern interventions were used, but the virus readily spread, taking the lives of doctors and nurses. When patients were moved to the far less sophisticated Bach Mai Hospital, which lacked some of the more advanced equipment, windows were open due to a lack of air conditioning.",
            "According to some of the doctors, this slowed the spread of the virus by preventing it from adhering to surfaces and people in the hospital. ",
            "China is likely to take a serious economic hit as a result of the nCoV2019 virus. The SARS epidemic cost the global economy $54 billion, according to a World Bank estimate, and the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to affect Chinese tourism and trade. Seventeen years after SARS, China --  now the second largest economy in the world --  is likely to experience a higher scale of costs and burdens to execute nationwide containment strategy. But Beijing has no choice. The virus is already everywhere.",

Still, neither the King County Health Department nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent personnel Thursday to provide assistance -- though they have since. ",
            "First responders were concerned that staff members were not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment to handle the high number of patients with probable coronavirus. They also arrived to the facility to find employees using positive pressure bag valve masks to ventilate potential coronavirus patients -- even though firefighters have been told not to use such masks, as they can disperse more particulate into the air, the responder said.",

            "Chinese health authorities said that at least 547 cases had been confirmed in the mainland, with eight new deaths linked to the virus in Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital. Cases were also confirmed in the Chinese territory of Macao and the self-governing island of Taiwan.",
            "Beyond China, officials in Washington state on Tuesday confirmed the first case on US soil. The patient is a male in his 30s who is under observation at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett, said John Wiesman, Washington's secretary of health, at a press conference Wednesday. ",
            "Health officials have reviewed the travel history of the patient, said Dr. Chris Spitters, Snohomish Health District acting health officer on the patient's contact investigation. \"As of now, there are at least 16 identified close contacts,\" Spitters said. \"Local health departments started reaching out to them yesterday and continued doing so today.\" ",
            "Spitters said \"the risk to the general public remains low and the public health system and our health care partners are working swiftly and collaboratively to address this situation.\" ",
            "Cases have also been reported in South Korea, Thailand and Japan, and suspected cases detected in Australia. ",
            "Worldwide, a total of 555 cases have been confirmed since the outbreak was detected in mid-December. ",
            "However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not yet declared the virus a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" which might merit a coordinated global response.",
            "The organization's emergency committee met Wednesday in Geneva, but decided more information was needed to declare the status of the outbreak and what recommendations should be made regarding it. It is expected to take up the matter again on Thursday. ",
            "China on Tuesday announced it was adopting Class A prevention and control measures, typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. This means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients. China previously used such measures in 2009 to tackle an outbreak of H1N1, introducing mandatory quarantine for anyone who had \"close contact\" with an infected person, including foreigners arriving in the country from areas where H1N1 outbreaks had been reported. ",
            "Li Bin, China's national health commissioner, said that officials are aware of around 2,200 cases of \"close contact\" with known virus carriers. Regarding suspected cases, 715 patients have been discharged while more than 300 patients remain on medical watch. ",
            "The disease is mainly transmitted \"through the respiratory tract,\" said Li, adding that \"there is possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease.\" ",
            "While there are indications that Chinese authorities are ready to ramp up controls on travel -- including ordering that all trips to Wuhan be canceled and refunded -- it remains to be seen whether the virus, already reported in around a dozen locations, can be reined in before the Lunar New Year travel period truly kicks in. ",
            "The largest annual human migration on Earth, hundreds of millions of people will travel across China and overseas during the four-week period, which began in mid-January and continues until February. Many will go by train or plane, raising the risk of infection as they are put in close contact with other travelers. ",
            "What we know about the virus",
            "First identified in Wuhan in mid-December, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is in the same family of infections as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).",
            "Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city which was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species. SARS was previously linked to similar markets, particularly the sale of civet cats, a delicacy in some parts of China. ",
            "Speaking Wednesday, Li, the Chinese health official, said that Wuhan and Hubei provincial authorities should tighten the regulation of farm markets and wild animals. He also urged the public to avoid crowds and minimize large gatherings. ",
            "Chinese health officials said human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed, raising the chance of its spread. In one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient unknown to be carrying the virus were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily. ",
            "People were seen at a train station Wednesday trying to get train tickets to leave Wuhan.",
            "The true extent of the virus is unclear, and official figures may be an underestimation. A study by British researchers previously estimated -- based on the spread of the virus overseas in a relatively short time -- that the number of people infected in Wuhan alone was likely around 1,700. ",
            "However, so far the death toll is relatively low, and almost all cases involved elderly people with preexisting conditions: of the more than 400 confirmed cases in China, nine deaths have been reported so far, or 2.25%. By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of around 10%, and was even more deadly among vulnerable populations. ",
            "Worldwide effort",
            "With cases and suspected cases already reported across Asia and now as far afield as the US and Australia, containment efforts are being put in place in many travel hubs.",
            "Wuhan alone has connections with more than 60 overseas destinations through its international airport, while Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, all of which have reported cases, have hundreds more. ",
            "Airports across Asia have stepped up temperature screening of incoming passengers, as have several hubs in the US, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
            "Officials at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport put up signs at the international arrivals area instructing travelers from Wuhan to watch for symptoms of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started displaying the sign in English and Chinese on January 14, an airport spokesman said. ",
            "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a statement saying it was closely monitoring developments and is actively working with the WHO secretariat, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the CDC. ",
            "With all indications that the virus has a relatively slow incubation time, however, these efforts may be insufficient to stop its spread.",
            "\"You cannot absolutely prevent entry into the country of a disease like this. The incubation period is probably a week,\" Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Tuesday. \"It's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure people with a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention.\"",
            "Raising concerns about how difficult it is to detect those with the virus, even if they have some symptoms, a patient in South Korea told doctors there she had developed a fever and muscle pains on Saturday and was prescribed cold medicine by a doctor in Wuhan, before being sent on her way. She was later confirmed to have the coronavirus during a check in Seoul.",
            "In the US, the National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine for the new virus, though it will take at least a few months until the first phase of clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available.",
            "Scientists in Texas, New York and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.",

Posts on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, purportedly showed people lining up at night outside pharmacies across China to buy Shuanghuanglian, ironically going against the authorities' advice to avoid congregating in public. Such was the apparent demand sparked by the notice that the compound formula sold out on some stores on China's e-commerce platform Taobao. ",

The Wuhan Institute of Virology is also administered by the CAS and is among the country's most advanced virus research laboratories.",

Beijing is worried about unemployment, too, and has announced a wave of stimulus measures in recent weeks aimed at preventing mass layoffs.",

Shares of the country's three major airlines \u2014 Air China, China Southern and China Eastern \u2014 all closed down 2.5% or more in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Thursday. And the aviation sector is \"likely to remain under pressure as confirmed cases are set to increase,\" said Andrew Lee, equity analyst at Jefferies.",

            "China's consumer price inflation hit 5.4% in January, according to the country's National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. Prices rose last month at their fastest rate since October 2011, when China was battling to control months of soaring inflation. ",
            "Food, which makes up nearly a third of spending by Chinese consumers, is spiking the most. Pork \u2014 a mainstay in the Chinese diet that is already under pressure because of a devastating pig disease \u2014 skyrocketed a staggering 116% compared to a year ago. Vegetables were 17% more expensive.",
            "Other items saw modest price rises by comparison: Health care was 2.3% more expensive, for example, while clothing prices rose 0.6%.",
            "The statistics bureau acknowledged the role coronavirus played in causing prices to surge. In a statement, it attributed the increase to the outbreak and to the Lunar New Year holiday, which was observed in January this year rather than February, as it was in 2019.",
            "Economists at Citi blamed the price surge on the way the coronavirus has disrupted production and transport links.",
            "Dozens of Chinese cities have been on lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 900 people and infected at least 40,000, mostly in mainland China. Many factories and businesses were also shut down as government officials extended the holiday. ",
            "Hoarding is also a factor, according to analysts from Capital Economics. People are rushing to buy basic necessities, fearful of how long they may be stuck in their homes, state-owned media outlet Xinhua reported last week.",
            "Analysts at Nomura expect inflation to taper off a little in February, adding that the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday distorted the figures somewhat. But they said they expect the coronavirus outbreak to keep the consumer price index above 4% because of hoarding by households and supply shocks attributable to the lockdowns. ",
            "The government, aware of how high inflation could spark public discontent, announced Monday that it would increase imports of meat and daily necessities. A government official also told reporters that China had released over 100,000 metric tons of pork and 47,000 metric tons of vegetables from its central reserves since the coronavirus outbreak began. ",
            "Beijing has also sought to control the prices of groceries and medical supplies by encouraging companies to expand production and introducing steps to curb price gouging. ",
            "Late last month, regulators in Shanghai fined a supermarket store 2 million yuan ($290,000) after they said it deliberately hiked the cost of vegetables by as much as 692%. And in Zhengzhou, a city in central China, regulators recently fined a supermarket operator 500,000 yuan ($71,600) for charging as much as $2 a kilogram for cabbage. ",

            "They took a look at a calendar.  ",
            "The first known case of coronavirus anywhere in the world occurred in Wuhan, China, on December 8. For the next six weeks, people flew out of Wuhan and surrounding cities, until China locked down the area on January 23.  ",
            "Lessler's team set up a computer model to look at that time period and found that most likely about four people who were infected with coronavirus -- but possibly as many as 10 - traveled from Hubei province to California during this time. They looked at California because that's the state expected to bear the largest brunt of the outbreak.  ",
            "Lessler calls these estimates \"very rough\" and emphasizes that this is just modeling. ",
            "But if their model is right, and even one infected traveler entered California unnoticed during this time, he or she might have spread the disease to others.  ",

            "Looking for coronavirus in the community ",
            "The CDC knows there could be cases of coronavirus they might have missed. That's why they've set up surveillance labs in five cities -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City -- to look for cases. These labs, which routinely check patient specimens for flu, will start checking for coronavirus in specimens that test negative for flu.  ",
            "The surveillance plan was announced about two weeks ago, but it's unclear if it's started because there's been a delay in distributing lab kits. The CDC said Friday that more state and local labs were coming online for testing in the next few days.",

He said it's possible the Uber driver became infected and wasn't officially counted as a case, but he doubts that the driver started a large chain of transmission. ",

            "First is that early cases might have been missed, as demonstrated by the Johns Hopkins model.  ",
            "Secondly, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms, or are just mildly ill. Even someone coming off a flight from coronavirus hotspots such as China, Italy or South Korea might attribute feeling slightly ill to something besides coronavirus.  ",
            "\"That's human nature,\" NYU's Phillips said. \"They're going to think -- maybe it's the airplane food. I'm going to get better.\"  ",
            "Thirdly, some people traveling into the US from these hotspots might intentionally deny feeling sick because they don't want to be isolated in a hospital for two weeks. If they're on a flight from China, and they know they'll be checked for fever when they land in the US, they could take Tylenol or Advil to mask the fever.  ",
            "\"Being a suspicious New Yorker, I'm like, 'Prove it to me that people aren't going to do that,' \" Phillips said.  ",
            "And finally, so far 12 people have traveled through US commercial airports and were later found to be infected with coronavirus. For a period of time, these travelers were symptom-free before they were diagnosed.  ",
            "It's known that someone can spread coronavirus even before they develop symptoms. But health authorities have not routinely traced back all the contacts a person had before they became ill, so it's possible that some of them were missed and spread the virus.  ",

            "\"I don't trust the reporting in China, and I also believe that the China numbers reflect the most severe cases, so we're getting a skewed view of the case fatality rate and how severe this is,\" he said Wednesday.",
            "Fisman said that while the real numbers are likely to be somewhat higher than the official ones, most of the discrepancy probably involves mild cases.",
            "\"What I can tell you as someone who models infectious diseases, the virologically confirmed case numbers make sense to me,\" he said. ",
            "However, there are some questions remaining. ",
            "\"In China, the party line is 'this started in December',\" Fisman said. \"Those of us who are lucky enough not to have to parrot an official truth are able to say no, no, the phylogenetic data from the virus says early November, and epidemic models based on exported case counts, which we do trust, say early to mid-November.\"",
            "China's leaders have promised absolute transparency on the virus -- and the WHO has praised them for sharing information. Beijing has also vowed severe punishment for any officials found to be concealing or downplaying figures related to the outbreak. ",
            "Will we ever know the true number? ",
            "It can take years to get the real picture of an epidemic. Establishing the true extent of the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 was a long-term process, partly because China suppressed the reporting of it in the initial months. ",
            "But even if the authorities do everything they can to disclose accurate numbers, the full picture won't be complete until much later. ",
            "Testing could be an issue too. Asha George, executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, told the same US Senate hearing on Wednesday that China may be limited in its testing and reporting resources, versus simply \"a lack of desire on the part of the Chinese government to report.\"",
            "\"We won't really know what the true case fatality for this is until probably months or years from now when people do ... blood tests and find out how many silent infections that were in the population,\" Fisman said.",
            "He added that at the moment, health experts don't have a clear idea on how many of the cases reported from China is happening in health care centers and hospitals, where the fatality rate could be higher, because people who are in a hospital for another reason are more vulnerable.",
            "What does it mean for the world if we don't know the true number?",
            "Of course, having accurate information is key to combating an epidemic, because it helps epidemiologists forecast the spread of the disease, which in turn allows public health officials to put necessary measures in place.",
            "But while the number of reported cases plays a role, it is not the only -- and in some cases not even the most important -- way to measure an outbreak.",
            "\"We always measure big epidemics indirectly, usually using a few different data sources, knowing that all of them are going to be wrong in different places, but that the combined picture often is very, very helpful in terms of figuring out what must be going on,\" Fisman said. ",
            "Most epidemiologists know what the pitfalls are and can work around them, he said. ",
            "George told lawmakers that students at public health schools are often taught to \"multiply by seven or eight times what you've been told\" to account for cases that they can't see. ",

            "Hong Kong (CNN)As the world watches the developing crisis around the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, it's difficult to know how worried to be. One thing is clear, however: China is treating the matter extremely seriously.",
            "With the number of confirmed cases in the country approaching three thousand, and at least 80 deaths, China has placed almost 60 million people on lockdown, with full or partial travel restrictions on 15 cities across Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital. ",
            "Thirty provinces and major cities have activated their highest level of emergency response, with checkpoints erected on roads and screening of travelers at airports and train stations. The semi-autonomous region of Hong Kong has initiated a complete ban on anyone from Hubei, or non-residents traveling from the province, arriving in the city. ",
            "In Beijing, the Politburo Standing Committee -- the Communist Party's top body, headed by President Xi Jinping -- has taken direct control of the response. Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Wuhan Monday for a personal inspection of hospitals in the stricken city. ",
            "The unprecedented scale of the response speaks in part to the sheer size of China -- 60 million people is greater than the entire population of South Korea, and Hubei spans the equivalent area as Syria. Such a lockdown has never been carried out in China before, not even during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The cost of it is staggering, not just in terms of manpower or funds, but also the economic hit Hubei will take and the knock on effect this will have on the wider Chinese economy during a sensitive period. ",
            "That China is able to pull something like this off is thanks to the ability of a centralized, powerful leadership to react in a crisis. It's also a sign of just how vital it is for that leadership not to screw up. ",
            "Writing on Sunday, analysts Adam Ni and Yun Jiang said that the Chinese Communist Party's \"prestige and legitimacy are both on the line\" in how they handle the crisis. ",
            "\"Having realized just how serious this is, and how potentially destabilizing it is for the Party, the Party is now scrambling to fully mobilize resources to tackle the crisis,\" they added. ",
            "\"Xi's prestige is likely to take a hit, putting pressure towards collective leadership instead of the paramount leader model. Centralization of power under Xi means that inevitably Xi will take the blame if things go wrong, as would he be showered with glory when things go right. This is high risk, high reward for him.\" ",
            "Contrasting response",
            "As more and more becomes known about the initial spread of the virus and the dangers posed by it, suspicion has grown over how authorities in Wuhan handled the first weeks of the outbreak. ",
            "While there is always some uncertainty at first with regard to new pathogens, that officials in Wuhan held a major provincial Communist Party meeting, an attempt at a world record for the largest potluck lunch involving 40,000 families, and had police go after people spreading \"rumors\" about the virus online, does not cast them in the most positive light. ",
            "Many observers have speculated that some officials will be punished in the days and weeks to come, especially after Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted on state TV that the city's warnings \"were not sufficient\" and the infection rate will likely continue to climb.",
            "There is also the almost staggering contrast in how the crisis has been handled since the central government got involved. Xi himself last week ordered \"all-out efforts\" to contain the virus' spread and treat those affected, about a month after the virus was first detected. ",
            "Beijing-based commentator Wang Xiangwei described that as a \"watershed moment.\" ",
            "However, he added that the slow response from local officials was likely the result of \"deeply entrenched issues,\" ones that may have actually been exacerbated by Xi's much vaunted anti-corruption campaign. ",
            "\"Ironically, the Chinese leadership's keen efforts to push for accountability from bureaucrats and promise stiffer punishment for those who shirk responsibilities have contributed to their propensity to cover up disasters,\" Wang said. \"As Xi has consolidated his power and urged other officials to conform completely to the Party leadership, this has also strengthened a tendency to avoid making any important decisions and instead wait for specific instructions from the Party leadership.\" ",
            "Huge effort",
            "With more than a dozen countries now reporting cases of the virus, along with almost every region of China, the ability to rein in the pathogen's spread may be somewhat out of the hands of the Chinese government. ",
            "All eyes will be on the World Health Organization this week, to see if it reverses the decision to hold off on classifying the Wuhan virus as a \"public health emergency of international concern.\" Doing so could enable a more concerted international response, though many affected countries have already independently begun putting in the types of screenings and quarantines that might be recommended. ",
            "Inside China, since January 22 when Xi intervened the government response has been colossal, but this does not seem to be having the desired effect, perhaps because of how far the virus spread before a reaction was ordered. ",
            "Two brand new hospitals are being constructed in Wuhan itself to aid its overstretched healthcare system, due to be completed by next week, while an additional 1,200 health workers -- along with 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- will soon arrive in the city.",
            "But the hugely advanced infrastructure that China is relying on to contain the virus and transport aid and support to where it's needed, is also what helped spread the pathogen in the first place. ",
            "A month ago, few outside China may have heard of Wuhan, yet the city -- and a small wildlife market within it -- has managed to impact countries the world over; a sign of just how connected we all are in a globalized world. Attempting to control this inter-connectivity, as China's and other governments must do to stop the virus, may be far harder than reaping the economic benefits.",
            "The stringent measures placed on Hubei have also attracted criticism. Prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Zhang Xuezhong denounced them as \"savage\" online, earning him the opprobrium of many panicked commentators. They may also carry major downsides in the long run, Xi Chen, a public health expert at Yale University, pointed out that lockdowns not only have negative economic repercussions but also break down the \"social cohesion that binds people at this special moment.\"",
            "As Xi and the rest of the Standing Committee meet this week to discuss how to tackle the virus's continued spread, they may decide on more draconian tactics. Whether their response is successful remains to be seen, as perhaps the world's most powerful state apparatus grapples with what has bedeviled many of its predecessors -- the sheer size and scale of China itself.

Since then it has had many  successes, chief among them the eradication of smallpox and a 99% reduction in polio cases, as well as work against chronic disease and tackling tobacco usage. ",

            "The failure was blamed in part on the WHO's cumbersome and complex bureaucracy -- it is made up of six regional offices which are only loosely controlled by headquarters in Geneva. Other factors blamed for the Ebola failure include an overstretched and underfunded surveillance team, and political pressure from West African governments unwilling to take the economic hit caused by a PHEIC declaration.  ",
            "In a statement to CNN, a WHO spokesperson said that \"as a result of the lessons learned from West Africa, WHO established the new Health Emergencies Programme,\" which was \"a profound change, adding operational capabilities to WHO's traditional technical and normative roles.\"",
            "\"The program is designed to bring speed and predictability to WHO's emergency work,\" the spokesperson said. \"It brings all of WHO's work in emergencies together with a common structure across headquarters and all regional offices in order to optimize coordination, operations and information flow.\"",
            "But while Ebola may have highlighted some issues, experts had been sounding the alarm for years. In a 2014 report, former WHO consultant Charles Clift wrote that most observers -- including many former insiders -- agreed that the organization \"is too politicized, too bureaucratic, too dominated by medical staff seeking medical solutions to what are often social and economic problems, too timid in approaching controversial issues, too overstretched and too slow to adapt to change.\" ",
            "\"The WHO is both a technical agency and a policy-making body,\" Clift wrote. \"The excessive intrusion of political considerations in its technical work can damage its authority and credibility as a standard-bearer for health.\" ",
            "The WHO relies in part on data provided by member states, filtered through regional organizations -- a structure that was blamed for the delays in declaring Ebola an emergency. ",
            "With a government like China's, with a historical aversion to transparency and sensitivity to international criticism, that can be a problem.",
            "Taiwan in the dark ",
            "It is on the issue of Taiwan that Beijing's political sway at the WHO is most clear. ",
            "In an impassioned speech last year before the World Health Assembly (WHA), the organization's annual meeting in Geneva, Luke Browne, the youthful health minister of the Caribbean nation of St. Vincent, demanded that Taiwan be allowed a seat at the table. ",
            "\"There is simply no principled basis why Taiwan should not be here ... the only reason that it is not here now is because the government in Beijing does not like the current government in Taiwan,\" Browne said.  ",
            "Despite Browne's speech, and the intervention by several other member states, from Belize and Haiti in the Caribbean to the African kingdom of Eswatini and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru, the proposal to include Taiwan was swiftly struck off the agenda, as it has been every year since 2016.  ",
            "Taiwan is a self-governing democratic island of 23.7 million people off the coast of China. It has never been ruled by the government of the People's Republic, but is claimed by the authorities in Beijing as part of their territory. Beijing blocks Taiwan from participating in many international organizations unless it does so in a way that conforms to the \"one China\" principle, such as calling itself \"Chinese Taipei\" in the Olympics.  ",
            "Beijing's exclusion of the island from international organizations does not usually have global ramifications. Health is one area, however, where an effective international response requires that all governments be equally connected and informed. ",
            "\"Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO leaves its population vulnerable during this crisis -- a lack of direct and timely channels to the WHO have already resulted in inaccurate reporting of cases in Taiwan,\" said Natasha Kassam, an expert on China, Taiwan and diplomacy at Australia's Lowy Institute. \"Taiwanese authorities have complained about the lack of access to WHO data and assistance.\" ",
            "Similar concerns were raised during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, when Taiwanese scientists complained they were stonewalled by WHO officials, who told them to ask authorities in China for data about the disease. ",
            "The issue has global ramifications: Kassam pointed out that around 50 million foreign travelers pass through Taiwan's largest airport every year, \"with an expectation that Taiwan would be receiving WHO advice on any public health issue.\" ",
            "\"Taiwan's healthcare system has been consistently ranked one of the best in the world -- and at a time like this, every country should put politics aside to focus on containing the virus,\" Kassam said.  ",
            "As coronavirus cases were reported in Taiwan -- which has major business and cultural links with China no matter the discord politically -- the WHO couldn't even settle on what to call the island. Speaking to reporters last month, a spokesman used the bizarre construction of \"China, Taiwan;\" while a February 4 report flipped it and listed \"Taiwan, China,\" but got the number of cases wrong, relying on data from Beijing not Taipei. Subsequent reports have since dropped the term Taiwan altogether, instead including \"Taipei and environs\" in a list of affected cities in China. ",
            "When he addressed the WHA last year, Browne predicted just this type of confusion, saying \"we all know that the PRC does not exercise control and authority over Taiwan and cannot be reasonably expected to represent it here.\" ",
            "In a statement, a spokesperson for the WHO said that \"we are collaborating closely with Taiwanese authorities through the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\"",
            "\"WHO has received vital information from Taiwanese authorities and will be reporting back through established channels,\" the spokesperson said. \"WHO works with Taiwanese health officials, following established procedures, to facilitate fast and effective response, including through the IHR.\"",
            "The spokesperson added that with regard to the current outbreak, 'we have Taiwanese experts involved in all of our consultations -- the clinical networks, laboratory networks, and others -- so they're fully engaged and fully aware of all of the developments in the expert networks.\"",
            "Trapped in the middle",
            "Just as Beijing's sway at the United Nations means that Taiwan is likely never to regain its seat there, the WHO is unlikely to reverse course on this issue until Beijing does. While Taiwan's allies have spoken out in favor of it since the coronavirus outbreak began, China has far more diplomatic clout that it can bring to bear. ",
            "And this is the fundamental problem with the WHO: it cannot treat member states equally because they are not equal. During the Cold War, it was the United States that was seen as having too much influence, leading the Soviet Union and its allies to walk out from 1949 to 1956. The US retains major sway due to its position as one of the largest individual funders of the WHO, as do other major economies such as Japan and the United Kingdom, and private donors like the Gates Foundation. While it has not historically been a major funder, the WHO has praised China's \"growing contribution\" to global health initiatives. ",
            "Beyond financial issues, the WHO is also directly controlled by its member states, who nominate and elect the organization's director general and set its agenda. This means the WHO cannot afford, politically or financially, to antagonize countries like the US or China that wield outsized influence over other nations.  ",
            "\"If Tedros wants WHO to stay informed about what's happening in China and influence how the country handles the epidemic, he cannot afford to antagonize the notoriously touchy Chinese government -- even though it is clear the country has been less than fully transparent about the outbreak's early stages, and perhaps still is,\" Kai Kupferschmidt wrote in the journal Science this week. ",
            "Indeed, had Tedros done so, there would likely have been a raft of articles criticizing the WHO for needlessly offending China at a time of crisis and hamstringing its own ability to operate.  ",
            "Thomas Abraham, an associate professor at Hong Kong University Journalism and Media Studies Center and former WHO consultant, sums it up well: \"The WHO, and China too, is in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.\" ",
            "This article has been updated to reflect additional comment from the WHO. "

            "Xiao said her family had repeatedly urged her to go home, fearing that she will catch the virus in Wuhan. But she wants to stay to sell the sugar cane. However, business has been bad -- people are too scared to come to the market to shop, she said. ",

Some cities have also been effectively quarantined. That means major trouble for the world's second biggest economy. ",
            "The virus outbreak escalated just before the new year, one of China's most significant economic events. Chinese consumers spent more than 1 trillion yuan ($145 billion) last year on holiday shopping, dining, entertainment and travel, according to state news agency Xinhua. ",
            "Extensive travel restrictions and fears about the virus mean people aren't spending as much this week. But the extended holiday \u2014 to February 2 nationwide and for another week beyond that in Shanghai and several provinces \u2014 will impact millions of people in other ways as government offices and schools remain closed.",
            "Major companies such as Tencent (TCEHY), Huawei and Alibaba (BABA), will feel the effects, too, as head offices remain shut. Tencent (TENC) has told its roughly 54,000 employees that it will be extending holidays until February 9.",
            "Exactly how big the economic hit will be is hard to predict. China hasn't come to a complete standstill \u2014 the Shanghai Stock Exchange is reopening on February 3. Grocery stores and food delivery services are still up and running, even in areas under lockdown.",
            "ING economist Iris Pang said Wednesday that the outbreak would knock a modest 0.3 percentage points off China's first quarter growth. ",
            "But Tommy Wu, analyst at Oxford Economics, said the impact could be worse than the SARS outbreak in 2003, given the coronavirus is spreading rapidly and coincides with the holiday travel rush. Economists at Nomura warned that the outbreak could knock more than two percentage points off growth in the first quarter \u2014 larger than the quarterly drop registered during SARS. ",
            "Patrick Perret-Green, an economist with research firm AdMacro, said the hit to China's annual growth rate could be even more severe.",
            "\"There will be no quick recovery. China was growing strongly [during SARS], as was the rest of the world,\" he said. \"Now China and the global economy is like a patient on dialysis, and somebody just pulled an IV out.\"  ",
            "A big hit to growth",
            "Before the outbreak escalated this month, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had forecast China's annual economic growth to fall to about 6%, down from 6.1% in 2019.",
            "Perret-Green said the outbreak and measures to contain it could push China's 2020 GDP growth rate near levels last seen in 1990, when it was 3.9%, according to World Bank data.",
            "\"Officially it may be closer to 4.5% and possibly the reality could be close to zero,\" said Perret-Green, who suggested the government severely overstates its GDP figures to begin with.",
            "Margaret Yang, an analyst at brokerage firm CMC Markets, said the \"adverse economic impact is enormous.\" ",
            "All sectors will likely feel the effects of the delay in getting back to work, she said in a research note Tuesday, singling out transportation, tourism, entertainment, retail and commercial property. ",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus has already killed 132 people, and infected over 6,000 others in China, but is not yet as lethal as the 2003 SARS outbreak. SARS had a roughly 10% fatality rate, compared to the estimated 3% for the coronavirus right now.",
            "But the economic costs aren't only about how deadly the virus is, according to Andrew Batson and Ernan Cui, analysts at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. ",
            "\"These costs are instead going to be determined by the measures China's government takes to contain its spread \u2014 measures which have rapidly escalated to an unprecedented severity,\" they wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ",
            "Travel and tourism will have an outsized effect, Batson and Cui said. They noted that the sector raked in 514 billion yuan ($74 billion) during the seven-day holiday in 2019, equivalent to 2% of first quarter GDP. ",
            "Travel industry suffering",
            "There has already been a plunge in the number of trips made during the holiday. Liu Xiaoming, China's vice minister for transport, told reporters on Sunday that the overall number of trips made across the country on the first day of the Lunar New Year fell nearly 30% from a year ago. Travel by plane and train fell more than 41%, he added.",
            "Major travel companies, hotels and airlines are waiving cancellation fees and offering refunds through most of February. Some airlines are suspending services. ",
            "Meanwhile, major tourist spots including museums, Beijing's Forbidden City and even Disney's (DIS) parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have shuttered their doors. Beijing and other cities across China also canceled Lunar New Year celebrations, trying to limit crowds. ",
            "\"This will mean a permanent loss of revenue from tourist activities, as the canceled excursions are not going to be repeated after the holiday is over,\" wrote Batson and Cui. ",

            "Hong Kong (CNN)As the world watches the developing crisis around the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, it's difficult to know how worried to be. One thing is clear, however: China is treating the matter extremely seriously.",
            "With the number of confirmed cases in the country approaching three thousand, and at least 80 deaths, China has placed almost 60 million people on lockdown, with full or partial travel restrictions on 15 cities across Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital. ",
            "Thirty provinces and major cities have activated their highest level of emergency response, with checkpoints erected on roads and screening of travelers at airports and train stations. The semi-autonomous region of Hong Kong has initiated a complete ban on anyone from Hubei, or non-residents traveling from the province, arriving in the city. ",
            "In Beijing, the Politburo Standing Committee -- the Communist Party's top body, headed by President Xi Jinping -- has taken direct control of the response. Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Wuhan Monday for a personal inspection of hospitals in the stricken city. ",
            "The unprecedented scale of the response speaks in part to the sheer size of China -- 60 million people is greater than the entire population of South Korea, and Hubei spans the equivalent area as Syria. Such a lockdown has never been carried out in China before, not even during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The cost of it is staggering, not just in terms of manpower or funds, but also the economic hit Hubei will take and the knock on effect this will have on the wider Chinese economy during a sensitive period. ",
            "That China is able to pull something like this off is thanks to the ability of a centralized, powerful leadership to react in a crisis. It's also a sign of just how vital it is for that leadership not to screw up. ",
            "Writing on Sunday, analysts Adam Ni and Yun Jiang said that the Chinese Communist Party's \"prestige and legitimacy are both on the line\" in how they handle the crisis. ",
            "\"Having realized just how serious this is, and how potentially destabilizing it is for the Party, the Party is now scrambling to fully mobilize resources to tackle the crisis,\" they added. ",
            "\"Xi's prestige is likely to take a hit, putting pressure towards collective leadership instead of the paramount leader model. Centralization of power under Xi means that inevitably Xi will take the blame if things go wrong, as would he be showered with glory when things go right. This is high risk, high reward for him.\" ",
            "Contrasting response",
            "As more and more becomes known about the initial spread of the virus and the dangers posed by it, suspicion has grown over how authorities in Wuhan handled the first weeks of the outbreak. ",
            "While there is always some uncertainty at first with regard to new pathogens, that officials in Wuhan held a major provincial Communist Party meeting, an attempt at a world record for the largest potluck lunch involving 40,000 families, and had police go after people spreading \"rumors\" about the virus online, does not cast them in the most positive light. ",
            "Many observers have speculated that some officials will be punished in the days and weeks to come, especially after Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted on state TV that the city's warnings \"were not sufficient\" and the infection rate will likely continue to climb.",
            "There is also the almost staggering contrast in how the crisis has been handled since the central government got involved. Xi himself last week ordered \"all-out efforts\" to contain the virus' spread and treat those affected, about a month after the virus was first detected. ",
            "Beijing-based commentator Wang Xiangwei described that as a \"watershed moment.\" ",
            "However, he added that the slow response from local officials was likely the result of \"deeply entrenched issues,\" ones that may have actually been exacerbated by Xi's much vaunted anti-corruption campaign. ",
            "\"Ironically, the Chinese leadership's keen efforts to push for accountability from bureaucrats and promise stiffer punishment for those who shirk responsibilities have contributed to their propensity to cover up disasters,\" Wang said. \"As Xi has consolidated his power and urged other officials to conform completely to the Party leadership, this has also strengthened a tendency to avoid making any important decisions and instead wait for specific instructions from the Party leadership.\" ",
            "Huge effort",
            "With more than a dozen countries now reporting cases of the virus, along with almost every region of China, the ability to rein in the pathogen's spread may be somewhat out of the hands of the Chinese government. ",
            "All eyes will be on the World Health Organization this week, to see if it reverses the decision to hold off on classifying the Wuhan virus as a \"public health emergency of international concern.\" Doing so could enable a more concerted international response, though many affected countries have already independently begun putting in the types of screenings and quarantines that might be recommended. ",
            "Inside China, since January 22 when Xi intervened the government response has been colossal, but this does not seem to be having the desired effect, perhaps because of how far the virus spread before a reaction was ordered. ",
            "Two brand new hospitals are being constructed in Wuhan itself to aid its overstretched healthcare system, due to be completed by next week, while an additional 1,200 health workers -- along with 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- will soon arrive in the city.",
            "But the hugely advanced infrastructure that China is relying on to contain the virus and transport aid and support to where it's needed, is also what helped spread the pathogen in the first place. ",
            "A month ago, few outside China may have heard of Wuhan, yet the city -- and a small wildlife market within it -- has managed to impact countries the world over; a sign of just how connected we all are in a globalized world. Attempting to control this inter-connectivity, as China's and other governments must do to stop the virus, may be far harder than reaping the economic benefits.",
            "The stringent measures placed on Hubei have also attracted criticism. Prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Zhang Xuezhong denounced them as \"savage\" online, earning him the opprobrium of many panicked commentators. They may also carry major downsides in the long run, Xi Chen, a public health expert at Yale University, pointed out that lockdowns not only have negative economic repercussions but also break down the \"social cohesion that binds people at this special moment.\"",
            "As Xi and the rest of the Standing Committee meet this week to discuss how to tackle the virus's continued spread, they may decide on more draconian tactics. Whether their response is successful remains to be seen, as perhaps the world's most powerful state apparatus grapples with what has bedeviled many of its predecessors -- the sheer size and scale of China itself.

Many of them travel from rural areas to the cities to take on construction and manufacturing jobs or perform low paying but vital work, such as waiting tables in restaurants, delivering packages or acting as janitors.",
            "But because many factories and businesses remain shut down, millions of those workers might find it hard to land a job after the extended Lunar New Year holiday ends. More than 10 million migrant workers from Hubei province alone might also face discrimination from employers fearful that they may spread the virus. ",
            "Zhang warned that China's unemployment rate \u2014 already a concern for officials \u2014 could reach a record high in the coming months. The rate traditionally has hovered around 4% or 5%.",
            "He added the virus could also make consumer goods more expensive. Budgets are already tight because of rising debt, and a pork crisis brought on by the outbreak of African swine fever among China's pigs last year has caused the price of meat to skyrocket. Now vegetable prices have risen as people rush to buy basic necessities during the virus outbreak, according to the state news agency Xinhua. ",
            "Other challenges",
            "Dealing with the disease will make some of China's other problems that much tougher to solve \u2014 including its tricky trade relationship with the United States. ",
            "As part of a truce reached earlier in January, Beijing agreed to buy $200 billion worth of US products in the next two years. Analysts have already said that shrinking domestic demand in China will make it tough for the country to hit those targets. If the virus weakens the country's buying power even more, those goals could move even further out of reach. ",
            "Substantial tariffs totaling hundreds of billions of dollars also remain in place on many Chinese goods. And Washington has made it clear that those will remain a form of leverage as the two sides negotiate the next phase of their agreement.",
            "Even so, at least one analyst finds it unlikely that the trade war will escalate just because China is \"temporarily\" unable to honor its trade commitments. The United States is in an election year, and such an action could jeopardize President Donald Trump's campaign, said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank.",

            "The outbreak of the disease has already killed 492 people worldwide, mostly in China, and infected more than 24,500 people across 25 countries.",
            "In response, more than a dozen major airlines have canceled flights to and from mainland China. Several countries have also banned entry to foreigners who have traveled to China, while others have told their citizens not to travel there, or to leave if they can.",
            "The last time the aviation industry faced this kind of crisis was back in 2003, when the SARS outbreak cost Asia Pacific carriers $6 billion in revenue, according to the International Air Transport Authority (IATA). North American airlines lost $1 billion, while European carriers largely escaped unscathed, analysts say. It took nine months before international passenger traffic returned to normal, IATA said.",
            "The coronavirus will \"definitely\" surpass that $7 billion SARS hit, said Ivan Su, an analyst with financial services firm Morningstar.",
            "The global aviation industry, which generated $838 billion in revenue last year, will lose more money this time around for several reasons: The number of Chinese air travelers has ballooned since 2003. Chinese carriers, and the industry as a whole, are bigger now than before. And flight suspensions and travel advisories could last longer than they did during SARS, which would weigh on international airlines.",
            "A massive aviation market",
            "Around 660 million Chinese passengers traveled by air in 2019 \u2014 more than seven times as many as in 2003, according to state news agency Xinhua and Fitch Ratings. The vast majority of those trips are for domestic travel. The boom in China far outpaced the global increase in passenger numbers, which grew from 1.7 billion in 2003 to 4.2 billion in 2018, according to the World Bank.",
            "When SARS hit, global passenger traffic fell by 18.5% in April 2003 compared to a year earlier, with a drop of almost 45% in Asia-Pacific, Fitch ratings agency said in a report lat week.",
            "This time around, the drop could be far worse. The coronavirus outbreak hit just as China was preparing for the Lunar New Year, its most significant holiday. Millions of Chinese scrapped travel plans as Beijing took the extraordinary step of placing entire cities on lockdown to contain the virus. Officials said last month that air travel on the first day of the holiday period fell more than 41% compared to a year ago. ",
            "Lunar New Year aside, China has also become much more important to the global aviation industry. ",
            "It is currently the world's second-largest civil aviation market, behind the United States, hauling in 1.06 trillion yuan ($151 billion) in revenue last year, according to Xinhua. ",
            "Major Chinese carriers Air China (AIRYY), China Southern (ZNH) and China Eastern (CEA) \"have grown easily five to sixfold compared to 2003, when they were just very, very small compared to the rest of international carriers,\" said Shukor Yusof, head of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. ",
            "China Southern, the country's biggest airline, reported 43.7 billion yuan ($6.2 billion) in revenue in the third quarter last year. By comparison, Delta (DAL) \u2014 the top US carrier \u2014 reported revenue of $12.6 billion for the same period.",
            "Restrictions and cancellations ",
            "Extensive travel restrictions will also weigh on international carriers. ",
            "\"Airlines are more impacted today because China is the world's economic engine,\" Yusof said, adding that the sweeping flight cancellations made by American Airlines (AAL), Air Canada (ACDVF), British Airways and others are \"unprecedented.\" ",
            "\"This [outbreak] should be worse as travel bans have started early and it seems they will remain in force for a long period of time,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis. ",
            "During SARS, the World Health Organization issued its first emergency travel advisory about the illness in mid-March of 2003, nearly five months after the first reported cases began to emerge. The agency lifted travel advisories against Hong Kong and Beijing in May and June of that year respectively, once the outbreak had been contained in those hubs.  ",
            "Most flight cancellations during SARS lasted roughly two months, according to Su of Morningstar. ",

            "As of Monday, more than 2,800 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus have been confirmed in China and more than 80 people have died. More than a dozen cities across China have been either fully or partially locked down by authorities, impacting nearly 60 million people. ",

            "Source of the outbreak",
            "Officials from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said they have successfully isolated the virus in samples taken from a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan believed to be the source of the outbreak.",
            "Nearly three dozen of the samples taken from the market contained the nucleic acid of the coronavirus, and 31 of those samples were collected from the section of the market dedicated to the sale of wild animals, the CDC said.",
            "Footage taken from inside the market show wild animals such as snakes, raccoon dogs, porcupines and deer inside cages waiting to be purchased. The footage, which has not been independently verified by CNN, was posted on Chinese social media site Weibo.",

            "\"I would believe that this Wuhan outbreak was caused by animal virus and then the animal actually carried this back to the human,\" Poon said.",
            "China's demand for wild animals is largely driven by the belief that these animals provide health benefits when consumed. ",
            "The coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of South China. The civet is used in the popular \"Dragon-Tiger-Phoenix Soup,\" which is believed by locals to help with arthritis, stimulate poor blood flow and revive decreased libido, according to Slate. ",
            "Despite the SARS outbreak claiming more than 700 lives, recent footage shows civet cats being back on sale at a market in South China.",
            "Call for a sustained ban ",
            "While the trade of endangered species such as elephants and rhinos is already illegal in China, unprotected species can often be found in markets in smaller cities. Now, wildlife advocates are applauding China's move to temporarily ban the trade of wild animals, but some believe the ban should be permanent.",
            "\"Wuhan is a wake-up call. This is mother nature's revenge,\" said Freeland founder Steve Galster in a video posted to the organization's Facebook page. Freeland is working to end human and wildlife trafficking. ",
            "\"The way to prevent further outbreaks of this coronavirus from killing more people is to stop the wildlife trade. China just banned the wildlife trade. Let's keep that ban permanent,\" Galster said in the post.",

            "But now, the metropolis of approximately 11 million people in Hubei province has become the face of a deadly new coronavirus outbreak -- a stigma the people of Wuhan increasingly find themselves unable to shake off.",
            "With the death toll surging past 300 and 14,300 confirmed cases spreading all over China, local authorities across the country have activated the highest public health emergency response, stepping up screening of arrivals from Wuhan.",
            "However, fears over the spread of the outbreak have fueled resentment and discrimination against people from Wuhan. Some have become outcasts in their own country, shunned by hotels, neighbors and -- in some areas -- placed under controversial quarantine measures. ",
            "Wuhan officials estimate about 5 million people had left the city for the annual Lunar New Year holiday before authorities canceled all outbound flights, trains and buses in an unprecedented lockdown on January 23.",
            "Many of them are migrant workers or university students returning to their hometowns for new year family reunions. Others are holidaymakers taking advantage of the long annual break. ",
            "China only declared that the coronavirus could be transmitted from person to person on January 20, following a sudden jump in confirmed cases. Until then, authorities had said the outbreak was \"preventable and controllable.\"",

            "On social media, posts of Wuhan tourists seeking help for a place to stay sprang up. One user on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, claimed in a post last Sunday that she was kicked out by her guesthouse in Changsha, Hunan province, because guests from neighboring Hubei province were no longer allowed.",

            "She went to the train station, only to find out that no trains will stop at Wuhan anymore. She called the police, but was told to go to a \"relief station\" -- shelter for homeless people. She called the Wuhan mayor's hotline, to no avail. She even went to the hospital to get a health check, but still no hotels would take her. By then, she had already contacted more than 10 hotels and guesthouses, but was rejected by all, according to her post.",
            "\"I don't understand it. Even if all of us Wuhan people are 'walking dead,' to contain the outbreak's spread, shouldn't I be allowed to stay indoors? Now I'm forced to go out, and I've got nowhere to go,\" she wrote.",

She finally managed to check into a hotel later that evening, according to the regulator and her own subsequent posts.",
            "When contacted by CNN, Ludougao said she stood by her deleted post. She declined to comment further, saying she has been contacted by the government.",
            "Ludougao's plight was echoed by many others across the country. In southern Yunnan province, popular for its balmy weather and nature, there were so many Hubei tourists with nowhere to stay calling authorities for help that the provincial culture and tourism bureau issued a notice last Sunday ordering every city to designate at least one hotel to accommodate them.",

Unverified images on social media show roads leading to villages blocked by trucks, excavators, rocks, felled trees -- and in some cases dug up -- to prevent people from entering.",
            "The roadblocks were so prevalent that the country's ministry of transport had to issue a notice on Wednesday warning people against unauthorized blockage of roads, especially digging up roads to block rural traffic.",

It reads: \"This household has Wuhan returnees, please do not come into contact with them.\" The door -- still decorated with traditional red couplets for the Lunar New Year -- is being barricaded with multiple metal bars by several men in medical masks.

            "What federal quarantine entails exactly can depend on the circumstances, said James Hodge, director at the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University.",
            "Generally, individuals facing a mandatory quarantine are under a direct order from federal authorities to stay in the same place for a brief period of time while medical professionals assess whether they have been infected with a particular disease.",
            "In this latest case, people are being ordered to stay in facilities designated by the federal government, although in other potential situations, they could be confined to a hospital or their own homes, Hodge told CNN.",

            "Americans who have either been in China's Hubei province within the last 14 days or have traveled to other parts of mainland China and are showing symptoms associated with the virus will be screened at one of 11 designated US airports and subject to a mandatory quarantine at a nearby facility, the US Department of Homeland Security has announced.",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also quarantining Americans who have been evacuated by the State Department from Wuhan, the agency said. ",
            "\"This strategy is not meant to catch every single traveler returning from China with novel coronavirus. Given the nature of this virus and how it's spreading, that would be impossible. But working together we can catch the majority of them,\" Messonnier said in a call to reporters Monday.",

            "The government can only isolate or quarantine people who the CDC \"reasonably believes\" may be infected with or exposed to a quarantinable disease, which includes smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers and severe acute respiratory syndromes.",
            "Before issuing a quarantine or isolation order, the CDC conducts a public health risk assessment that considers a person's symptoms and whether they could have been exposed to the disease.",
            "The CDC has three days from the time they take a person into custody to serve them with an order for quarantine, isolation or conditional release.",
            "The CDC says it strives to use the \"least restrictive and time-consuming measures\" to protect public health. But keeping someone at a military base in California is considerably more restrictive than home quarantine, Hodge said.",
            "\"The CDC is clearly concerned, as we are globally, about any spread of this condition anywhere in the United States, and to be sure, that's a legitimate concern,\" Hodge said. \"But is it any different than what we've seen with prior infectious disease situations including Ebola and other fronts where we did allow for home quarantine under those circumstances? Most likely not.\"",
            "But it's possible that the CDC has information about the people in quarantine that they haven't released publicly, which could potentially justify the agency's case for this kind of quarantine, he added.",
            "CNN has reached out to the CDC about these questions but has not yet received a response.",
            "How long can someone be quarantined?",
            "The government can quarantine someone \"only as long as necessary to protect the public,\" according to regulations issued by DHS in 2017.",
            "In that time, the government would provide the public with health care options to protect against the disease, such as voluntary immunization or drug treatment, and ensure that quarantined people who have been exposed to the disease don't infect others. ",
            "Right now, there is no vaccine to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus. Experts say the best way to prevent infection is to avoid exposure to the virus.",
            "While the novel coronavirus has killed more than 400 people in mainland China, US officials say that the overall risk to the American public is low.",
            "There are currently 11 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the US -- nine of those people had recently traveled to Wuhan. The other two remaining cases had sustained contact in close quarters with people who traveled to Wuhan. ",
            "What rights do people in quarantine have?",
            "People who are in quarantine are entitled to a written order from the CDC within 72 hours of being apprehended that explains why the agency thinks quarantine is necessary.",
            "If a person in quarantine believes the CDC has made a mistake, they can request that the agency reassess its written order within 72 hours. If the CDC maintains that quarantine is necessary, the person can request an independent medical review to determine whether the CDC's recommendation is appropriate. They can also hire representation to be present at the medical review at their own expense. ",
            "Those who can't afford to hire their own representation can have a representative appointed at the government's expense.",
            "People in quarantine also have the right to take their concerns to court.",
            "Who foots the bill for this?",
            "If a person has health insurance, the CDC will bill their insurance provider for costs of care delivered during quarantine, according to Hodge. So depending on their insurance coverage, a person could be responsible for some or all of those costs.",
            "During the public comment period for HHS' latest rule on quarantine regulations, which went into effect in 2017, a flight attendant union argued that the federal government should pay for any medical costs incurred by flight attendants in quarantine. But HHS rejected the suggestion.",
            "\"... While it is not HHS/CDC's intent to unduly burden individuals with the costs of their own isolation or quarantine, payment for expenses will be made consistent with constitutional and ethical obligations to provide for the basic necessities, e.g., food, medical treatment, for those subject to such public health orders,\" the department said in its final rule.",
            "For those who are deemed unable to afford health insurance, the government will pick up the tab but Hodge said it might outsource some of those costs to programs like Medicaid when possible.",
            "Evans told CNN that the evacuees at March Air Reserve Base will be billed for their evacuation flight. He doesn't know what other evacuees are being charged, but he said that his own bill is for $1,100. And once the quarantine is up, he said everyone will have to pay their own way to their final destination. ",
            "What happens if someone violates the quarantine?",
            "If someone decides to walk out and violate evade quarantine orders, there will be consequences.",
            "Federal law states that a person who violates quarantine orders are subject to a fine of up to $100,000, a year in jail or both, if the violation doesn't result in a death. If it does result in a death, the person would be subject to a fine of up to $250,000, a year in jail or both.",
            "When was the last time a federal quarantine happened?",
            "Before concerns about the novel coronavirus, the last time US officials issued a federal quarantine order was in the 1960s for smallpox evaluation, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told reporters Friday.",
            "The CDC defines quarantine as separating and restricting the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they get sick.",
            "It's more common for the agency to issue federal isolation orders, which separate people who have been infected with a contagious disease from those who have not been infected. The CDC said it issues about one to two orders for quarantine, isolation or conditional release a year.",
            "Are quarantines effective? ",
            "In general, confining people who have or could be suspected to have a disease like coronavirus to one place is effective to prevent it from being transmitted to others, Hodge said.",
            "But how quarantine orders are executed make a big difference, he said. Compelling people to stay in a facility away from their home for period as long as two weeks could have unintended consequences. People could potentially lie about or misrepresent their degree of exposure to a disease to avoid that kind of situation, Hodge said.",
            "\"The potential implementation of federal, heavy-handed quarantine can be problematic and can backfire,\" he said.",
            "Allowing people to be contained within their own homes would be a better solution, Hodge said, and would make people more willing to comply.",
            "But CDC officials said on Friday that once people are educated on why the federal government believes quarantine is necessary, they mostly cooperate.",
            "\"We understand that this is a difficult situation for them. They've been through an ordeal,\" Messonnier said. \"And we're asking them to take the time with us to make sure that they're protecting their families and their communities, and we really admire their flexibility and resilience.\"",

            "But historically a mass quarantine is an aggressive response that's far from perfect. In the past it has led to political, financial and social consequences. ",
            "The shutdown of Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people where the virus originated, is \"utterly incredible,\" Howard Markel, professor and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, told CNN. ",
            "\"I've never seen an entire city 11.4 million people cordoned off like that,\" Markel said. \"I thought I'd seen everything.\"",
            "Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization's Center on Global Health Law, said the move was \"unprecedented,\" and, he thought, \"very unwise.\" ",
            "\"Nothing on this scale has ever been tried,\" he told CNN. \"There's very little evidence of its effectiveness. And I think there's good reason to think that it could backfire, from a public health, social, human rights perspective.\" ",
            "No quarantine goes perfectly",
            "Quarantines date back to Italy in the 1300s, as the bubonic plague ravaged Europe. In Venice, sailors and ships coming from infected ports were made to wait 40 days before docking in a practice called \"quaranta giorni,\" or \"40 days.\" ",
            "People criticize quarantines because in practice a virus or bacteria \"invariably gets loose,\" Markel said, as do people. \"Every quarantine, people get out,\" he said. \"They just do, especially one of this magnitude.\"",
            "Large-scale quarantines like the one in Wuhan are generally avoided nowadays, with the medical community more focused on providing treatment, medication and vaccines to prevent them entirely, according to Markel.",
            "Quarantines \"can stay things or quell things for a while,\" he said, \"but they're not the best things to use long-term.\"",
            "They can also lead to logistical issues. Just the word \"quarantine\" can cause panic or hysteria, Markel said. Anyone concerned about a common cold or sniffle will head for hospitals, straining already precious resources. Wuhan officials have already acknowledged local hospitals were struggling to accommodate people seeking medical attention.",
            "There are also human rights implications when Wuhan and more than a dozen other Chinese cities are placed under lockdown, Gostin said. \"I don't think you can enforce a mass quarantine of 30 million people without violating human rights.\" ",
            "Gostin also questioned the effectiveness of the approach, pointing to smaller quarantines during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. \"It spurred public violence, there was ... distrust of public health authorities, people didn't come in for treatment and it was thought that it actually set back the outbreak response considerably,\" he said. ",
            "There are broader financial and social consequences",
            "But outside the realm of public health, quarantines can present broader societal problems. Perhaps most obvious is the economic impact.",
            "Quarantines \"are often very economically and financially costly,\" said Alexandre White, an assistant professor of sociology and the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. ",
            "The flow of trade in and out of the quarantined zone is halted, and goods in the process of being shipped could go bad -- depending on how long it lasts. ",
            "\"As any quarantine extends, the economic and social hardships on the community under quarantine will expand, requiring the delivery of food and services and also hindering local economic activity,\" he said. ",
            "These economic impacts are a large part of why quarantines are seen as a \"less desirable course of action,\" White said. ",
            "Then there are the social consequences, White said, particularly for marginalized members of a community. Historically, he said, the aggressive control needed in a quarantine can link the disease to marginalized people and potentially fuel existing anxieties about race and class. ",
            "White pointed to an outbreak of bubonic plague in Cape Town in 1901 that led to a racially segregated quarantine camp, which he said was later used as a blueprint for racial segregation during apartheid.",
            "Markel told CNN there was a \"long history of quarantine being misused as a social separator, rather than a public health one.\" ",
            "\"There's a risk of stigmatization,\" he said, \"that marginalized groups are rightly concerned about and fear.\" ",
            "Trust and cooperation are key",
            "There's still a lot that's unknown about the coronavirus outbreak and how Chinese officials are responding to it. ",
            "But generally, the trust and cooperation of the public is the most important thing for officials to have in a public health crisis, said Gostin. ",
            "Without it, people won't come in for testing and won't share the names of people they've been in contact with -- a vital part of the strategy to prevent the spread of disease. ",
            "\"People get fearful, they hunker down ... You can't go to social clubs, you can't see friends. A lockdown of 30 million people -- that really upends their lives.\" ",
            "Gostin believes the best way to tackle a situation like the one in Wuhan is a \"surge of the public health response,\" he said. It should be easier for people to get to hospital and there should be mobile clinics that meet people at their homes to provide testing and treatment.",
            "Governments implementing a quarantine should still want the public's cooperation, said Markel. The government should provide plenty of explanation and keep up constant communication",

A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease.",
            "Read: What exactly is a coronavirus?",
            "Zoonotic transmission",
            "Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans.",
            "Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans.",
            "In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market.",
            "The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses.",
            "The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. The authors further found that the viral RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the \"crown\" of the virus particle that recognizes the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people.",
            "How influenza jumped from animals to humans",

            "The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes.",
            "Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species -- bats -- to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.",
            "The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus' source animal.",

            "The commentary continued, \"while the virus battle continues, normal social and economic operations are being restored. People are on their way back to work after the Spring Festival holiday. Some are wearing masks, and some are working at home to prevent infections. Many years later, it will become an unforgettable memory for the Chinese.\" ",
            "The country's Ministry of Commerce encouraged supermarkets and grocery stores to resume operations Thursday, as the economic and societal toll of having much of the country on voluntary or mandatory quarantine began to take its toll. Businesses have also been asked to \"resume operation in an orderly manner while continuing to fight the novel coronavirus outbreak.\" ",
            "The economic shocks from the virus -- and the prolonged shutdown of many factories and businesses across China -- are being felt worldwide, with ramifications for the global oil industry and automakers. ",
            "Hong Kong in particular is feeling the pain from the virus outbreak. The semi-autonomous Chinese city was already in a technical recession due to the US-China trade war and over six months of protests, and a massive drop in tourists and business due to the outbreak has further pushed down the economy.

WHO is playing an important coordinating role by bringing the scientific community together to identify research priorities and accelerate progress.\"",
            "Some people at the frontline of the outbreak are the thousands currently holed up on two cruise ships in Japan and Hong Kong, on which all passengers and crew are being tested for the virus. ",

            " (CNN)Fissures between the White House and national health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have begun to expand as the coronavirus pandemic spreads to more American states, creating dissonance between President Donald Trump and the professionals tasked with containing the virus further.",
            "The two sides have grown increasingly distrustful of one another, people inside both the CDC and the White House say, as officials on each side question decisions that either appear designed to downplay the growing crisis or to generate further concern.",
            "The cracks are falling along predictable lines. While health officials have sought to present a realistic and cautious picture of the national situation, Trump and his political allies are hoping to relay an altogether different message: that the virus is contained, Americans face little risk, and life should proceed as normal.",
            "Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, didn't deny there was a disconnect between the administration's messaging and the warnings from public health experts when asked by CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" Monday.",
            "\"I can only speak for myself, Alisyn. As you know, every time I have come in front of this camera -- with CNN, \"New Day\" or any other place -- I tell you exactly what I feel, based on the data. I give you my honest opinion of what we should be doing, my honest evaluation, the same way as I'm doing today. But I can't speak for everyone who is involved in this,\" Fauci said.",
            "Trump himself continues to insist he's satisfied with the work his team is doing to contain the virus and keep Americans safe. But top aides are doubtful he'll remain cheery for long as headlines question his handling of the outbreak and more Americans contract the virus.  ",
            "From its earliest days, Trump has sought to downplay coronavirus' risks and lashed out when those within his administration appeared to be doing otherwise. He told a collective of executives at the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland, in mid-January that it would not pose a major threat to the United States, an attendee told CNN. ",
            "During a 36-hour trip to India in February, Trump grew irate upon hearing that some administration officials, including National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases director Nancy Messonnier, were offering what he determined was an overly fatalistic assessment of the crisis.",
            "And he's complained that certain officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, were too alarmist in their messaging about the virus. He's said that doomsday scenarios and overly pessimistic predictions helped tank markets, according to people familiar with those conversations.",
            "This week, some White House officials privately said certain steps taken over the past two months by the CDC were ill-advised. A delay in developing adequate tests -- a critical breakdown in the administration's response -- is being pinned on the leaders of the CDC, FDA and HHS by Trump's allies, who say the failure has led to embarrassing questions of competence for the administration. ",
            "Already, the White House was frustrated by decisions the CDC made during the coronavirus outbreak, like the call to leave Americans aboard a cruise liner in Japan and later the move to evacuate them to the United States, which were taken without input or knowledge from the West Wing. Some top officials have privately questioned whether CDC boss Robert Redfield is up to the task of confronting the virus.",
            "Trump has privately warned those working most closely on the coronavirus response -- including Azar and Vice President Mike Pence -- that their message must not stoke fears or panic, according to people familiar with his directions.",
            "Still, some of those closest to Trump have been forced to confront the realities of the situation. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a top Republican ally in the House of Representatives, appeared to be mocking the virus when he wore a gas mask to votes on the House floor last Wednesday. Late last week, one of his constituents died after contracting coronavirus.",
            "After a number of Trump allies -- including then-acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney -- appeared to blame the news media for spreading panic about coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an attendee of the gathering tested positive, leading to investigations into the potential spread and at least two lawmakers going into self-quarantine.",
            "Some Republicans in Washington are concerned Trump's premium on loyalty -- only enhanced in the post-impeachment era -- has hampered efforts to combat coronavirus. ",
            "\"The message is if you are on the wrong side of this administration you are gone,\" one senior Republican official with ties to the coronavirus response said. \"People are afraid. Either there was terrible incompetence, or there was a heavy hand on the scale.\"",
            "The message coming from the White House has been to downplay the risks of the virus, leading to confusing public statements that often appear contradictory and unhelpful. ",
            "Trump's visit to the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta Friday did little to quell concerns among federal health professionals that the President is ignoring their warnings to create a rosy picture of the situation. He misstated the availability of coronavirus testing, deemed himself a natural expert in epidemiology and attacked political adversaries instead of relaying words of caution and advice that some officials have advocated. ",
            "The dynamic continued over the weekend as federal health officials continued to diverge from -- or completely contradict -- Trump and his top officials.",
            "Azar was forced to clarify Trump's statement from his visit to the CDC that \"anyone who wants a test can get a test\" during an off-camera briefing at the White House on Saturday.",
            "\"You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test,\" Azar told reporters. \"That is our medical system in the United States, in the same way that you may not get a cardiac medicine if your doctor doesn't prescribe that.\"",
            "By Sunday there were further signs of discord. Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, warned the virus would appear in more and more states -- even though some top White House aides, including chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow and counselor Kellyanne Conway, said on Friday it was being contained.",
            "\"We're shifting into a mitigation phase, which means that we're helping communities understand, you're going to see more cases. Unfortunately, you're going to see more deaths,\" Adams said.",
            "Other officials offered more clear-cut warnings to elderly Americans about traveling and convening in large groups than Trump has been willing to offer himself.",
            "\"If you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable, so it's our responsibility to protect the vulnerable,\" Fauci said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"",

            "Groups of Americans arriving from China have been taken to military bases, hotels or other sites to wait out a federally-mandated 72-hour waiting period. ",
            "From there, it's a long and sometimes monotonous waiting game. The March Air Base evacuees aren't beholden to any schedule, except for meal service times, twice-daily medical screenings and morning meetings with the health officials.",
            "Two weeks in limbo",
            "The 195 people on Evans' flight were ushered to March Air Base for their quarantine, one of the five military bases now being used for such purposes. A few hours after their arrival. a passenger from the flight was caught leaving the base, prompting the CDC to extend their quarantine. ",
            "So, Evans and some of his fellow evacuees are whiling away the hours until their two-week period ends.",
            "\"Everyone is doing pretty fine. People understand that the quarantine is necessary,\" Evans tells CNN. \"[They're] doing a good job keeping us busy and giving us all what we need.\" On-site case managers from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) were able to ship Evans' laptop to him so he could work. Children under quarantine have gotten toys to play with and can participate in organized activities to burn off their nervous energy. ",
            "However, the evacuees aren't able to leave the grounds of the base. No one else is staying in the hotel where they're being housed. And every day plays out under the watchful eye of health officials. ",
            " \"We get medical checks twice a day \u2014 in the morning and at night. In the morning you get your temperature checked,\" Evans says. \"We have a meeting at 10 am every day. It's with some of the medical officials who are here on the base and also with the [ACF] case managers.\" ",
            "The case managers are there to attend to the evacuees' needs, whether they be practical, like a work laptop, or more mental health-oriented.",
            "Citizens under federal quarantine are entitled to basic needs, like food and medical care. Evans says the food is nothing fancy, but it will do, and it's free. Breakfast is usually something like eggs, sausage and a muffin, and lunch could be a sandwich with chips and a pickle. ",
            "Playing the waiting game ",
            " Evans, who played football at the University of Cincinnati, moved to Wuhan two years ago to play football for the Chinese National Football League's Wuhan Berserkers. ",
            " He's facing a decision that a lot of other evacuees are probably weighing as well: Where to stay in the states while Wuhan battles the deadly virus that originated within its borders. Evans lives in Miami, but is originally from New York City, where he owns and operates a rideshare company. He'll probably stay with family there when he's allowed to leave.",
            " Once the quarantine is over, officials have offered to shuttle evacuees to Los Angeles International Airport so they can get on a flight and get back to their lives. ",
            " Until then, evacuees at the hotel are able to talk to their families as often as they'd like. Evans says his family isn'y necessarily worried, just waiting it out. \"As long as I am in good spirits when I talk to [my family], they're in good spirits too,\" Evans says. ",
            " \"We stay to ourselves in the evenings,\" Evans says.  \"We usually eat and then go back to our rooms and do our own thing. People just want to get out of here and get to their families. Everyone is respecting one another.\"",
            "\"No group hugs or shaking hands though,\" he adds. ",
            "Leaving behind a ghost town ",
            " A two-week quarantine may seem excessive for a disease that is still heavily localized in mainland China, but the Wuhan coronavirus has gotten exponentially more prevalent since it was first recorded in early December 2019. The virus has been confirmed in more than 25 countries and territories, and governments across the world have taken similar evacuation measures to get their citizens home and make sure the virus doesn't catch hold on their shores. ",
            "Evans says when he left Wuhan, there was no panic. There were no cars on the road. No people outside. ",
            "There was nothing. ",
            "\"It's still a ghost town,\" he says. ",
            "He's talked to friends who are still in Wuhan, and they say people are just trying to stay civilized while they endure the quarantine. At first, Evans says, the scene in Wuhan was chaotic. But now, most people stay inside their homes, hoping their stockpiles of food and supplies will get them through the worst of it. ",
            "In comparison, a few days holed up in a Southern California hotel seems like a small price to pay for health and safety.",
            "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the type of flight that ferried Evans back to the US. He and his fellow passengers flew on a charter flight into March Air Reserve Base. It also stated on-site case workers are from the CDC. They are from the Administration for Children and Families.",

            " (CNN)Just what is it about potential pandemics that scare us so? While the odds of dying from a car accident or heart disease are greater -- at least in the United States -- rare infectious diseases still loom larger in our collective nightmares.",
            "The truth is, the odds don't factor into what frightens us. Our rational minds aren't calling the shots here -- our irrational fears are. There is something supremely unsettling about the invisibility of germs and viruses and the way they spread that invokes our deepest, most primal survival instincts.",
            "But here is a quick reality check: While the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has produced a dozen confirmed cases in the US (mostly involving people who recently traveled to Wuhan, China, where the virus originated), the common flu has affected approximately 19 million Americans and killed about 10,000 people so far this season. ",
            "Anxiety can sometimes be a constructive response, as it inspires caution and careful analysis of a situation before jumping in. But as anyone who has experienced overwhelming anxiety can attest, it is not likely a response based on logic, facts and figures, or realistic threat levels.",
            "The public may respond with panic, fear and suspicion-- and sometimes even outright superstition, paranoia or moral judgement when it comes to unfamiliar illnesses. The victims, even after recovery, may be shunned and discriminated against. Communities, even families, can be torn apart.",
            "People who are fearful may follow not only the guidelines recommended by health experts, but go far beyond them: My children can't be in a classroom with your children, we don't want a clinic in our village, you aren't allowed entry back into the country under any circumstances.",
            "When the 1918 influenza killed 759 people in Philadelphia in one day alone, John Barry, who chronicled the pandemic in his 2004 book The Great Influenza, wrote, \"Fear began to break down the community of the city. Trust broke down. Signs began to surface of not just edginess but anger, not just finger-pointing or protecting one's own interests but active selfishness in the face of general calamity.\" ",
            "Dangerous misconceptions can emerge out of this pervasive fear, anxiety and ignorance -- the less people know, the more they might panic. The results can be deadly. We saw this around victims of AIDS, SARS, and Ebola. Indeed, health workers and responders battling the latest Ebola outbreak suffered more than 300 attacks in 2019 by armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo, leaving at least six dead and 70 wounded. ",
            "Outbreaks can, indeed, be terrifying, and often involve mass casualties. And there's no denying that some diseases have the potential to kill in horrific ways. In their relentless march from host to host, infectious diseases seem to underscore what we know, but -- whistling past the graveyard -- try to ignore. We are vulnerable, we are mortal, we will all die. ",
            "But when our emotions and fears take over, we have difficulty making rational decisions. We become anxious or angry and unable to process information. Experts might be trying to get out the facts in a clear and concise manner, but if you're already in an emotionally vulnerable place, you might not be hearing them. Public health professionals have long recognized the importance of acknowledging people's feelings and reassuring them with facts.",
            "One helpful resource is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which presents the latest confirmed statistics and gives scientifically valid advice on preventing the spread of respiratory diseases like coronaviruses, including: washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or with alcohol-based hand sanitizer; avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; and staying home when you are sick. ",
            "Facts do win out in the end, although this may take years. When was the last time anyone except for the most alarmist among us worried that the person sitting next to us on the subway or serving our salad had HIV/AIDS? And yet, there was a time when \"AIDS hysteria\" was commonplace, and a Florida family, whose three young sons were infected with AIDS, were subjected to bomb and death threats and a school boycott before their house burned down in a suspicious fire.",
            "We all live in a world with random, indiscriminate threats: terrorist attacks, plane crashes, unexpected losses and unexplained illnesses.",
            "In the face of a perceived threat, try to listen calmly -- with an open mind and an open heart -- to the facts. And rather than run from your fears or get stuck in them, try to be present with your anxieties and transform your fears. Use them to make yourself more cognizant of your surroundings and to do what is appropriate to take care of yourself and those around you.",

            " (CNN)As an outbreak of a novel coronavirus has swept through Hubei province, China, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been preparing for its worst case scenario -- a widespread outbreak of illnesses in the United States.",
            "\"Right now we're in an aggressive containment mode,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an interview on Thursday.",
            "\"We don't know a lot about this virus,\" he said. \"This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission.\"",
            "As of Thursday, there have been 15 cases of the novel coronavirus confirmed in seven states: eight in California; two in Illinois; and one in Arizona, Washington, Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Texas.",
            "This 'will become a community virus'",
            "While more research is needed to fully understand the virus, Redfield told Gupta that the CDC has focused on surveillance to track cases and containment strategies to slow possible progression of the virus in the United States. Slowing progression gives more time for researchers to work on developing and testing a vaccine and antiviral drugs for this novel coronavirus. Currently, there is no known cure for the virus.",
            "\"The containment phase is really to give us more time. This virus will become a community virus at some point in time, this year or next year,\" Redfield said. \"We don't have any evidence that this coronavirus is really embedded in the community at this time, but with that said, we want to intensify our surveillance so that we're basing those conclusions based on data.\"",
            "The containment strategy refers to efforts to prevent widespread transmission of the coronavirus in the United States, including having people with confirmed cases stay in isolation and placing restrictions on travel between affected areas in the world. Such containment measures were used widely during the SARS global outbreak of 2003, during which 8,098 people worldwide became sick and of those, 774 died, according to the CDC.",
            "Due to the current novel coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration has put in place travel restrictions that block foreign nationals from entering the United States if they visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival to the United States.",
            "Restrictions also apply to US citizens who have been in China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, in the two weeks prior to their return to the United States. Upon their return, those citizens will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days.",
            "World Health Organization officials and other experts have criticized travel restrictions on foreign nationals, even arguing that such restrictions could backfire.",
            "\"We reiterate our call to all countries not to impose restrictions that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Ahanom Ghebreyesus said last week during a media briefing in Geneva.",
            "US officials have defended the government's response, saying they're taking important steps to prepare for the virus and slow its spread -- and that the timing of their efforts is key.",
            "\"Frankly, some people criticized when we decided that we wanted to temporarily suspend travel into the United States from individuals who were not Americans or permanent residents who had been in the hot zone in the last 14 days. Some people didn't think that that was what they would do,\" Redfield told Gupta on Thursday. ",
            "\"Well, we felt very strongly that our obligation was to do all we can to protect the American public,\" Redfield said. \"I would rather be criticized for over-protecting America than under-protecting America at this stage.\"",
            "Regarding the travel restrictions on foreign nationals, Gupta asked, \"Obviously, Dr. Redfield, the virus doesn't discriminate based on race. Why do we?\" ",
            "In response, Redfield spoke more to the restrictions on US citizens, saying, \"The issue here was first a strong commitment to take care of the Americans that are going to come back, whether they happen to potentially have this virus or not -- and you saw that with the over 800 individuals that the State Department has repatriated and we've assisted in that.\"",
            "Concerns about the virus' spread",
            "When it comes to preventing spread of the virus and learning more about the pathogen, Redfield told Gupta that he thinks asymptomatic transmission of the novel coronavirus is possible and concerning.",
            "In other words, Redfield said that an infected person not showing symptoms could still transmit the virus to someone else, based on what he has learned from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. ",
            "\"There's been good communication with our colleagues to confirm asymptomatic infection, to confirm asymptomatic transmission, to be able to get a better handle on the clinical spectrum of illness in China. What we don't know though is how much of the asymptomatic cases are driving transmission,\" Redfield said.",
            "\"What I've learned in the last two weeks is that the spectrum of this illness is much broader than was originally presented. There's much more asymptomatic illness,\" Redfield said. \"A number of the confirmed cases that we confirmed actually just presented with a little sore throat.\"",
            "Weeks into the outbreak, CDC still not invited to China",
            "Meanwhile, Redfield said that the CDC has been eager to help China in its efforts to fight this outbreak. Nearly six weeks after the CDC first offered to help China with the coronavirus outbreak, the offer still has not been accepted.",
            "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus was first identified in early January.",
            "\"There's a lot of information we don't know -- that's why I offered to provide assistance, direct assistance, and send our CDC folks over there back on January 6 to really help them gather that information and also to help us see the information first hand that we need to help make the right public health recommendations for our nation,\" Redfield said.",
            "\"That letter has not been responded to yet by the official Chinese government,\" he said. \"We do believe that we're the best in the world in this space and we're ready to help and assist them, but they're an independent nation that has to make that decision that they're going to invite us in.\"",
            "According to WHO, there are more than 47,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus worldwide, with the vast majority in mainland China.",

Read more opinion on CNN. ",
            " (CNN)The coronavirus outbreak in China seems terrifying. Drone video clips of a deserted Wuhan, its bustling streets emptied of pedestrians due to fear of contact with those who might be carriers, continue to pop up on my social feeds, along with mounting casualty numbers. Over 7,700 people are now infected with the illness; over 170 people have died, and the disease has popped up in at least 20 territories and countries around the world, from Australia to Vietnam. ",
            "But the disease isn't the only thing that's spreading -- or the only thing causing harm. Across the internet, we've seen widespread eruptions of racist scapegoating, blaming Chinese for a disease that has so far only killed Chinese. The posts frequently claim or imply that the epidemic is the result of Chinese eating habits and hygiene, often pointing to a Chinese social media clip in which a female \"influencer\" is seen eating a bowl of bat soup, while saying that Chinese \"eat anything and everything and infect the world with viruses,\" calling Chinese a \"dirty people who can't keep order,\" and warning people to \"think twice before ordering anything Chinese.\" ",
            "At the root of these reactions is something deeply insidious and very familiar. Throughout history, cultures have used ugly slurs on the savagery, backwardness or filthiness of foreigners as a way to rationalize excluding them, ejecting them or eliminating them; we're seeing this today in the language that Trump and some in his administration often use to talk about Latin American migrants and other communities, framing them as bestial and subhuman, as violent and barbaric, as diseased and unclean, all to rationalize inhumane policies. ",
            "Food and hygiene slander have long been the spear tip of attacks by contemptuous (or envious) Westerners seeking to make Chinese seem impossibly alien, and thus unassimilable and inadmissible to their \"civilized\" countries. Back at the turn of the 19th century, Chinese were commonly regarded as \"dirty, heathen rat-eaters\"; vintage ads for a pest poison called \"Rough on Rats\" played on this perception; also by suggesting that it was nearly as effective at controlling vermin as hungry Chinese people, while op-eds took that stereotype and expanded and elevated it to fearful, monstrous proportions, with a typical editorial in the September 29, 1854 edition of the New York Daily Tribune calling Chinese \"uncivilized, unclean, filthy beyond all conception, without any of the higher domestic or social relations; lustful and sensual in their dispositions,\" and warning the federal government to ban further influx of Chinese into the United States.  ",
            "Spurred on by these descriptions, some took it into their own hands to reduce the number of Chinese in the country, gathering vigilante bands to burn down Chinatowns and kill their residents. One of the bloodiest mass murders of Chinese took place right here my city of Los Angeles in 1871, as a mob of over 500 invaded the city's old Chinese quarter and slaughtered and hung 20 men, mutilating their corpses in the deadliest known single lynching incident in US history. ",
            "By 1882, the tenor of Sinophobic rage was so great that the US Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, banning new immigrants from China entirely and making it unlawful for existing Chinese in America to ever become citizens. The Act is still the only law in American history to ever restrict entry to the US explicitly on the basis of race, and it wasn't repealed for 61 years, when the 1943 Magnuson Act finally permitted an entry quota of just 105 Chinese per year. ",
            "Today, hostility toward China is experiencing in an edgy spike, fueled in part by Trump's trade war and frothing fusillades of tweets. The impact is being felt by Chinese Americans, as researchers of Chinese descent, many of them US citizens, are being purged from universities and technology companies, and questions of loyalty that haven't been raised for decades are creeping into public discourse. As the coronavirus epidemic spreads, Asians of all backgrounds are reporting that they're being treated with unnerving suspicion, to the point where some are joking that they plan on coughing loudly in public just to \"see who's racist.\" There are sotto voce whispers to avoid Chinatowns and other places where Asians congregate. There are calls from the fringe to ban the entry of Chinese to the US.  ",
            "And it's not just America where Chinese and other Asians are reporting this. Thea Suh, a friend of mine from Germany -- a country with four confirmed coronavirus cases -- says that news outlets there have featured commentators suggesting that Asians \"deserve\" what they're getting, while she's personally observed train passengers visibly covering their mouths and moving away from where she's seated. \"Racism against people of Asian descent has been subtle in Germany, but it has always been here,\" she told me. \"With this recent coronavirus outbreak, it has just gotten worse...we are basically stuck between getting ridiculed and being the recipient of disgust.\" ",
            "This coronavirus is new. But the diseases of xenophobia and racism are not. And as history has shown, outbreaks of the latter are potentially harder to contain, and far more lethal.",

Officials said they plan to resume normal class operations on March 30 when the spring quarter begins, \"pending public health guidance.\"",

It said airlines could lose 19% of their business if the virus isn't contained soon. ",

            "\"The turn of events as a result of [the coronavirus] is almost without precedent.

            "Travel restrictions and a lack of demand from customers have  encouraged dozen of major airlines to cancel flights to and from mainland China because of the coronavirus. Transatlantic flights, as well as capacity on routes within Europe and the United States, have also been curtailed. ",
            "Struggling UK carrier Flybe collapsed earlier Thursday as the slump in demand killed off hopes of a government-backed rescue. Scottish airline Loganair said it would take over 16 of Flybe's routes over the coming months.",

            "The possibility of other airlines seeking bankruptcy protection or going out of business will depend on a number of factors, including the length of the outbreak, the cash position of various airlines and how quickly passenger demand returns once the crisis has passed, IATA's de Juniac said.",
            "\"It's difficult at this stage to say [whether there will be more bankruptcies],\" he told CNN Business. \"If the duration is comparable to past outbreaks of SARS or the H1N1, and it's four to five months, the industry should overcome [the crisis], perhaps with some casualties. If it lasts longer, it will be more difficult for a larger number of airlines.\"",
            "'It has a 9/11 feel'",
            "De Juniac said the industry has already asked some governments for relief from fees and charges airlines pay. And he raised the possibility of direct government bailouts for airlines, similar to what took place in the United States after the 9/11 attacks.",

            "Instead of helping on the frontlines, she has been under self-quarantine at home for weeks, after a chest scan on January 26 revealed that she had a suspected case of the novel Coronavirus.",
            "Zhu was told to wait for a nucleic acid test that would provide the final verdict, but it never came.",
            "\"Right now, it's really a problem. Our hospital already has more than 100 people who are quarantined at home,\" she told CNN over the phone. An additional 30 medical workers have been confirmed to have the virus, she said. ",
            "\"If the tests are fine, we can go back to work. I actually don't have any symptoms, there's just a slight problem with my CT scan, it seems there's a bit of infection,\" she said.",

She declined to publicize the name of her hospital and asked to use a pseudonym as she was not authorized to speak to the media. ",
            "The situation at her hospital is not unique. A nurse from the Wuhan Central Hospital said on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, that around 150 colleagues at her hospital have been confirmed or suspected to be infected -- including herself.",

            "On Friday, it was revealed that 1,716 healthcare workers nationwide had been infected by the virus,  six of whom had died, according to China's National Health Commission (NHC). Nearly 90% (87.5%) of those medics came from Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital.",

            "Health care workers have long faced a high risk of infection during major outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that swept China from late 2002 to 2003. In Wuhan, the epicenter of the noval corronavirus outbreak, however, that risk is now exacerbated by a dire shortage of medical resources to cope with the influx of patients, as well as the government's belated warning of the high-infection rate.  ",
            "In Wuhan alone, 1,102 medical workers have been infected, accounting for 73% of infections in the province and 64% nationwide.",
            "The city of 11 million people has 398 hospitals and nearly 6,000 community clinics. However, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has designated nine hospitals to treat coronavirus cases, as well as an additional 61 hospitals whose outpatient clinics will receive patients with fever -- believed to be a common symptom of the pneumonia-like illness. ",
            "In some of these designated hospitals, medical staff have made up a significant percentage of infected patients.  ",
            "For example, at Zhongnan Hospital, one of the 61 hospitals dealing with cases, 40 health care workers had been infected, accounting for nearly 30% of the 138 coronavirus patients admitted by the hospital from January 1 to 28, according to a research paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week.",

            "The Wuhan government has acknowledged the shortage of medical supplies, such as specialist N95 respiratory masks, goggles and protective suits. Hospitals across Wuhan have pleaded for help repeatedly on social media, calling for more donations of the protective gear, which are vital in protecting frontline staff from catching the virus from patients.",
            "On Weibo, a post by the state-run People's Daily showed medical personnel in a Wuhan hospital creating protective gear out of plastic trash bags.  ",
            "Apart from the lack of masks, gloves and protective suits, medical workers have also been stretched to their limits by the crushing workload. Cross-infections among hospital staff are thought to have taken place in tea rooms and meeting areas, after long grueling shifts, according to David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, citing doctors who were sent to assist hospitals in Wuhan from Beijing.

Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted on CCTV late last month that his government did not disclose information on the coronavirus \"in a timely fashion.\"  ",
            "Chinese authorities repeatedly stressed in the early days of the outbreak that no health care workers were infected -- an important sign for possible person-to-person transmission used to suggest that the virus was not that contagious.",
            "Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who died from the coronavirus, had tried to warn others early on in the outbreak but was silenced and punished by police for \"spreading rumors.\"  The suppression of Li, along with other medics who tried to sound the alarm on the virus, has likely led to unnecessary cross-infections inside hospitals, as well as in families and communities.",
            "China's Supreme Court said in a commentary on January 28 that had people listened to Li's warnings they could have \"adopted measures such as wearing masks, strict disinfection and avoiding going to the wildlife market.\"",
            "Instead unaware of the health risks, many doctors and nurses were only wearing disposable masks when treating potential coronavirus patients at the beginning of the outbreak. Ivan Hung, chief of the Infectious Diseases Division at Hong Kong University, said those masks alone are \"definitely inadequate\" in fending off the virus.",
            "\"Basically, medical staff should be wearing N95 masks, goggles or face shields, and protective suits not only in isolation wards, but also at emergency departments and medical wards -- basically anywhere that one might get in touch with coronavirus patients,\" he said.",

He later died after contracting the virus unwittingly from a patient on January 10, sparking an outpouring of grief and outrage, as well as calls for freedom of speech. \"I was wondering why (the government's) official notices were still saying there was no human-to-human transmission, and there were no healthcare workers infected,\" Li said in a post on Weibo. ",
            "According to a study of the first 425 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Wuhan published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month, seven health care workers in Wuhan had already shown symptoms of infection between January 1 and 10.",
            "But on January 11, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission was still insisting that \"as of now, no infection among medical staff has been found,\" reiterating that there had been \"no clear evidence for human-to-human transmission.\"",
            "The World Health Organization also said in its statements on January 14 and 17 that China had not reported any cases of infection among health care workers.",
            "It was not until January 20, when Zhong Nanshan, a government-appointed respiratory expert, declared on state broadcaster CCTV that the new coronavirus could spread from person-to-person, that the infection of medical workers was revealed.",
            "As evidence for human transmission, Zhong, an 83-year-old doctor known for fighting the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago, disclosed that 14 medical workers in a hospital had been infected by one patient. ",
            "The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission admitted in a statement that as of January 21, \"a total of 15 health care workers have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus,\" and another one was suspected to have been infected, too. One of them was in serious condition, the statement added.",
            "Since then, however, the commission has not announced any updates on the number of confirmed or suspected cases among the city's hospital staff, even as Chinese media have published multiple reports offering a glimpse into the true scale of infections in hospitals.",
            "Spread of the problem",
            "The infection of medical workers is not only happening at the designated Wuhan hospitals, but is also being seen at other facilities and cities across China.",

            "When reached for comment on the cases, the hospital's director told China Newsweek: \"We now have discipline requirements and cannot accept phone interviews anymore,\" the report said.",
            "Meanwhile, the virus has spread to every region in mainland China, including the far western frontier of Xinjiang and the remote region of Tibet. Authorities in Beijing and the provinces of Guangxi, Jiangxi and Hainan have all reported individual cases of infection among hospital staff, amounting to two dozens people.",
            "By Tuesday, a fund set up by ByteDance, the Beijing-based startup behind popular short video platform TikTok, to help health care workers stricken by the coronavirus had already sponsored 190 infected medics, including five who have died, the company said in a statement to CNN.",
            "Before Friday, the NHC had not provided a tally of infected medical workers. It finally released the numbers more than two months into the outbreak, at an inter-agency briefing arranged by the State Council on the safety of medical workers.",
            "During SARS, the Chinese authorities appeared to become more forthright about the infection of medical staff following an initial attempt to cover-up the outbreak. By mid February 2003, the Guangdong provincial government had announced that 105 of the 305 SARS cases found in the province were medical workers. The Ministry of Health, the predecessor of the National Health Commission, also included the number of health care workers in its briefings of infection numbers, with breakdowns by provinces. ",
            "By May 30, 2003, a total of 966 medical workers had been infected, accounting for 18% of the 5328 cases across China, according to the ministry.  ",
            "For now, the infection rate of health care workers appears to be much lower than during SARS. The 1,716 infected medical staff as of Tuesday only account for 3.8% of all confirmed cases, the NHC said.",
            "Hung, the professor at Hong Kong University, said he was confident that frontline medical workers are now equipped with better protective gear than those produced 17 years ago during the SARS epidemic. He also believed that they are being churned out in factories to meet the demand.",

            "So, as I read the first reports of a cluster of animal-market related illnesses, with the first patient exhibiting symptoms of pneumonia as early as December 12, 2019, I had a chilling sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. By New Year's Eve, it was obvious something akin to SARS -- as it turns out, the Wuhan coronavirus is in the same family of viruses as SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) -- was unfolding in China.",
            "The mysterious pneumonia virus that emerged from a live animal market in China's central city of Wuhan last month has now infected far too many people, over far too vast a geographic area, to be easily controlled.",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus -- part of a family of viruses that are common among animals and can cause fever as well as respiratory symptoms when transmitted to humans -- has been found in cities all over China, and travelers have since spread the virus to several countries, including Singapore, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea as well as Hong Kong and Macau.",
            "The first American case -- involving a man in his 30s who recently traveled to Wuhan -- was confirmed outside Seattle on January 21, before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Friday a second case in Chicago. As of Friday, at least 41 people have died from the illness.",
            "I warned that China appeared to be taking more aggressive steps shutting down social media posts, arresting people accused of spreading \"rumors\" and capping the flow of information about the outbreak than it was halting the transmission of the virus. For more than a week, the reported number of cases barely changed after local authorities shut down the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, the putative source of the virus. And authorities insisted the cause was neither SARS, nor similar viruses like the flu, avian flu, or MERS.",
            "They also repeatedly stated that there was no evidence of human-to-human spread of the disease (which turned out to be false), leading the World Health Organization and outside world to believe that closing the live animal market effectively brought the outbreak to a halt.",
            "As recently as January 18, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention posted stern warnings against paying heed to \"rumors\" and insisted there were no cases of the disease in hospitals outside of Wuhan, adding that the outbreak was \"preventable and controllable.\"",

            "Separate studies from London's Imperial College and Hong Kong University Medical School estimated that some 1,300 to 1,700 people were infected during the first week of January, when Chinese officials reported just a handful of cases and downplayed the epidemic's severity. This week, the Imperial College team estimated that there were a total of 4,000 cases (with the possibility of up to 9,700 cases in the worst-case scenario) by January 18, when the official tally was still at 62 cases.",

            "Despite the wide disparity in the figures, this new epidemic seems poised to eclipse the scale of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and is already well outside of the reach of simple control measures.",
            "Hong Kong University virologist Guan Yi, who was part of the team that discovered the SARS virus, tells the Washington Post that the epidemic is so out of control now that \"a bigger outbreak is certain.\" He said that even with a conservative estimate, the outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic -- with a reach of more than 80,000 cases.",
            "Speaking on background, other SARS veterans tell me there may already be \"many thousands\" of infected individuals in China.",
            "Because authorities initially downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak instead of implementing swift control measures, people have traveled to and from Wuhan -- a major transportation hub with a population of 11 million people -- and unwittingly carried the virus with them.",
            "Chinese authorities have shut down flights, ferries, highways, and trains leaving Wuhan, as well as public transportation within the city. Twelve other cities in China have issued travel restrictions in an unprecedented move to contain the virus just days before the Lunar New Year on January 25, which usually ushers the largest human migration on earth, with hundreds of millions of people traveling to see relatives.",

Finally, Wuhan provincial communist party chief Jiang Chaoliang, and his counterparts in neighboring districts, came under veiled criticism from President Xi Jinping who ordered Party leaders to \"put people's safety and health as the top priority and take effective measures to curb the spread of the virus.\"",
            "On January 20, China's National Health Commission designated the new disease a Class B infection, although it was treating the virus as a Class A infection -- meaning mandatory quarantines and community lockdowns may be used to stop its spread.",
            "And the following day, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission posted on social media that, \"Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people.\" The commentary also warned that \"anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity\" and stressed that transparency was the best defense against rumors and widespread fear.",
            "Not surprisingly, reported numbers of cases from all over China jumped dramatically after Xi's speech and subsequent pressure from Beijing. This has confused matters considerably, making it impossible to tell how much of the soaring epidemic toll is due to a surge in actual new infections, versus release of case numbers that local authorities had been covering up.",
            "Worse, despite calls for openness, SARS hero Dr. Zhong Nanshan, who was celebrated for his 2003 efforts, gave a televised interview on January 20 in which he warned that 14 healthcare workers were infected in Wuhan, the risk to medical personnel is acute, and severity of threat will rise if the virus mutates. Zhong, who had initially made several appearances on Chinese television, has not been featured on broadcasts in recent days, with some speculating that the government is now silencing him. ",
            "But Zhong's warning represented sound science. As the leading Chinese virology team wrote, after comparing the genetics and proteins of the new virus and SARS, \"the Wuhan nCoV poses a significant public health risk for human transmission,\"  because it -- like SARS -- has the ability to bind to a protein found on the surface of most human lung cells. \"People also need to be reminded that risk and dynamic of cross-species or human-to-human transmission of coronaviruses are also affected by many other factors,\" like the host's immune response, the speed with which the viruses can multiply inside human lungs, and the potential mutations that might make the virus more virulent or transmissible. ",
            "Regardless of how transparent Beijing may now become, what I witnessed tracking SARS across Hong Kong and China, and subsequent investigations of sites hit by the disease in Hanoi, Bangkok, Singapore, Toronto and Hong Kong augurs poorly for this new viral epidemic and China's ability to bring it to a rapid resolution.",
            "While 17 years has brought significant improvements in virology, diagnostics development, international health regulations and the WHO, and we know more today about the nCoV2019 virus (as the Wuhan coronavirus is awkwardly dubbed) than we did one month into the SARS epidemic, there is no magic wand that can wave this highly dispersed, airborne-spread, human-to-human transmitting microbe away.",
            "After the initial coverup, Beijing is now executing the playbook that ultimately stopped SARS. The city of Wuhan is now on lockdown and fever checkpoints are operating in most major transit hubs across the country while Lunar New Year celebrations have been canceled. Instant contagious quarantine 1,000-bed facilities are under construction, with one due to open next week outside Wuhan. One key step -- closing all live animal markets nationwide -- has not yet been implemented.",
            "I discovered in 2003 that wildlife dealers and animal breeders sell their living creatures all over the country, so that an infected animal in one city's market may well have a counterpart from the same dealer, on sale in another market hundreds of miles away. It is not yet known what beast was the source of nCoV2019, though one study suggests, based on genetic analysis of the virus, that it came from a snake. The SARS virus was transmitted to restaurant workers who bought and slaughtered live civets -- raccoon-like animals in a Guangzhou live animal market, which I investigated before authorities shut it down.",
            "Like the Guangzhou market, Wuhan's Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market sells a vast range of animals, including civets as well as other exotic wild animals. All live animal markets throughout China and neighboring Asian countries should be shut down immediately, and not reopen until the source of the nCoV2019 epidemic is identified. Until then, it should be assumed that any live animals sold in markets from Hanoi, Vietnam, to Ulan Bator, Mongolia, might be dangerous to hold, slaughter or consume.",
            "To stop the SARS epidemic in 2003, governments, hospitals and public health authorities resorted to measures that mirrored infection control in the early 20th century, focusing on taking temperatures to find individuals with fevers, and then placing those people -- regardless of the causes of their febrile states -- in mandatory quarantine. Eventually, with the feverish souls separated from the rest of humanity, the virus stopped spreading. By June 2003 the Chinese government was able to declare victory over SARS, eight months after the virus first emerged. ",
            "Here is what it will take, then, to stop the Wuhan virus.",
            "First, the flow of people who are infected has to stop and transportation across the entirety of China must be monitored or restricted. The Wuhan animal market from which nCoV2019 arose is located less than 0.5 miles from one of the city's train stations, where several high-speed rails stop. It must be assumed that people, and their live animals, walked that short distance earlier this month to take the trains -- possibly carrying the virus with them to cities across China.",
            "A post from Wuhan Railway that has since been deleted said 300,000 people traveled out of  Wuhan by train on Wednesday. It is imperative that the tough lockdown measures unfolding this week presage nationwide travel restrictions.",
            "During the SARS epidemic, a brave military physician leaked medical documents to Time magazine, providing proof that SARS patients were secretly being treated in People's Liberation Army facilities in Beijing. Once word was out, I watched as tens of thousands of Beijing residents climbed onto trains, fleeing the city -- and taking SARS to every corner of the country.",
            "After the exodus from Beijing in 2003, authorities erected fever check stations in every air, bus and train terminal in China, and placed policed health stations along the nation's highways. Fever-check stations were so abundant that I was typically tested 10 to 12 times a day in Beijing, and every 10 to 20 miles while driving on major highways.",
            "The Chinese government has started erecting a network of fever stations in transit hubs, and I expect this will ramp up considerably over the coming week. Social media posts already show several photos and videos of officials erecting roadblocks, barricades, and traffic diversions to police-manned fever stations and similar measures reminiscent of what I witnessed in 2003.",
            "Currently, family members of known nCoV2019 patients are tested for infection and placed under surveillance. Chinese authorities are already tracking hundreds of close contacts of known patients, and this will escalate radically over coming days. Apartment complexes and hotels that are known to have housed a nCoV2019-infected person will also be scoured.",
            "There must also be a safe place to quarantine people who are running temperatures. In 2003 I watched in frank astonishment as teams of Chinese workers erected entire hospitals -- complete with air filters, special sewage systems and electricity -- in just days, province-by-province. A similar effort is now underway in Wuhan.",
            "By far the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. Both MERS and SARS spread like wildfire through unprepared medical facilities, regardless of the comparative wealth and sophistication of the hospitals. Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: one had just a single healthcare worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments.",
            "The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training, which taught staff to work in teams and make sure that any contaminated protective gear was safely removed without contact with the skin, face, eyes or hands.",
            "Over the last few days, many Chinese social media users have posted dramatic videos and photos of over-crowded hospital emergency room facilities, in which frantic patients and family members are crammed together and healthcare workers are hard-pressed to control the influx, as the infectious spread of the virus is surely occurring. In the SARS epidemic, hospitals eventually realized the need to set up fever check stations outside the facilities, screening would-be patients, and ushering febrile individuals into an entry separate from other hospital admissions.",
            "In Toronto and Singapore, which have remarkably good healthcare systems and state-of-the-art facilities, hospital workers struggled mightily to stop spread of SARS, and healthcare workers who were infected died. In some of my discussions with physicians and nurses that went through the SARS nightmares, I have learned that the wealthier facilities were, perhaps, at greater risk because they had more equipment and procedures to apply to patients, including intubation and lavage, which was used to remove  fluids from the lungs that built up in response to infection.",
            "When SARS hit Hanoi, patients were originally taken to the prestigious French Hospital, where modern interventions were used, but the virus readily spread, taking the lives of doctors and nurses. When patients were moved to the far less sophisticated Bach Mai Hospital, which lacked some of the more advanced equipment, windows were open due to a lack of air conditioning.",
            "According to some of the doctors, this slowed the spread of the virus by preventing it from adhering to surfaces and people in the hospital. ",
            "China is likely to take a serious economic hit as a result of the nCoV2019 virus. The SARS epidemic cost the global economy $54 billion, according to a World Bank estimate, and the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to affect Chinese tourism and trade. Seventeen years after SARS, China --  now the second largest economy in the world --  is likely to experience a higher scale of costs and burdens to execute nationwide containment strategy. But Beijing has no choice. The virus is already everywhere.",

            "United will ax flights in the United States and Canada by 10% and overseas flights by a total 20% in April from its original international schedule. That includes overseas flights that were canceled several weeks ago. United is looking at similar domestic and international cuts in May. ",
            "The moves were disclosed in an email Wednesday to employees made available to CNN. It also disclosed a hiring freeze, a program of voluntary unpaid leaves of absences or a reduced schedule for US employees and a delay of scheduled pay raises for management employees.",

            "The escalating global health crisis has claimed more than 200 lives -- all in China -- and infected close to 10,000 people worldwide. As they seek to contain the virus, authorities in multiple countries are balancing the need for warnings against the risk of creating global panic.",
            "However, there are signs that's already happening, with face masks selling out in stores and people locking themselves at home. Some people in central China -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- are desperately taking any flight out, regardless of destination, as governments worldwide suspend flights from China and impose restrictions on travelers from the mainland.",
            "But the panic has also taken another, more familiar form, with the re-emergence of old racist tropes that portray Asians, their food, and their customs as unsafe and unwelcome.",
            "As panic spreads, so does racism",
            "As news of the virus has spread, many people of Asian descent living abroad say they have been treated like walking pathogens. ",
            "Writing for the UK's Guardian newspaper, one British-Chinese journalist in London said a man quickly moved seats when he sat down on a bus.",
            "A Malaysian-Chinese social worker experienced the same thing on a London bus this week. \"A couple of people at an East London school I work in have asked me why Chinese people eat weird food when they know it causes viruses,\" she told CNN.",
            "In Canada, there have been reports of Chinese children being bullied or singled out at school. In New Zealand -- where there are no confirmed coronavirus cases -- a Singaporean woman says she was confronted and faced racist harassment in a mall.",
            "These instances echo a long history of racism in the West. During the Yellow Peril era, anti-Chinese fears led to lynchings of Chinese immigrants, racial violence, systemic discrimination -- even an outright ban on Chinese immigrants for 61 years in the US under the country's Exclusion Act.",
            "That's why the term \"Yellow Peril,\" which contains centuries of trauma, is so charged -- and why the use of it in a contemporary headline was so stunning.",
            "However, this time around anti-Chinese racism is spreading beyond the West. In Vietnam, signs have been seen outside restaurants declaring \"No Chinese.\" The tourist who took the photo told CNN the sign appeared in the past week. Similar signs were also posted outside a Japanese shop, turning away Chinese customers.",
            "And people online from various different places are making racially driven jokes; when TV host James Corden posted a photo with Korean-pop band BTS, one person tweeted, \"BREAKING: James Corden dies of the coronavirus.\" The joke racked up nearly 25,000 likes on Twitter.",
            "Targeting Chinese food",
            "Perhaps the most widespread form of xenophobia comes in fearmongering, sensationalist stereotypes about Chinese food.",
            "The novel coronavirus is believed to have started in a Wuhan seafood and wildlife market, and scientists have pointed to bats and snakes as possible virus carriers. And while the wildlife trade poses legitimate problems, the outbreak has prompted a racially tinged wave of disgust toward Chinese food, and anger from many who accuse Chinese people of recklessly causing a potential global pandemic.",
            "\"Because of some folks in China who eat weird (foods) like bats, rats, and snakes, the entire world is about to suffer a plague,\" said one popular tweet.",
            "This idea has been reinforced by recent media coverage of the coronavirus, some of which has featured misleading videos or photos. One widely shared video, of a Chinese travel blogger eating bat soup, was filmed three years ago in the Pacific island nation of Palau, and the dish has been sampled by Western TV hosts in the past. ",
            "The video and the blogger have no connection to Wuhan or the current outbreak -- but the video has gone viral nonetheless, with many Western viewers expressing horror on social media. There was such an uproar that the blogger came forward to apologize last week.",
            "What viral misinformation and breathless media coverage often miss is that only a small minority of people in China actually eat wild animals. Most people eat much of the same things you would see in other cuisines, like pork or chicken. Ultimately, what people like to eat is culturally relative -- a lot of the Western disgust toward \"weird\" Chinese food is itself Eurocentric.",
            "That's not to say all criticism of Chinese food is invalid; the country does have a problem with badly-regulated trade of wild animals, which has led to previous outbreaks.",
            "The deadly 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was traced to the civet cat, considered a delicacy in southern China. And though the government has introduced some measures limiting wildlife trade, it has been reluctant to take more aggressive action, and illegal trade continues.",
            "It's also difficult to end these practices because of the cultural significance and prevalence of traditional Chinese medicine. Many of these wild animals are thought to hold important medicinal properties -- for instance, people drink snake soup for arthritis and snake bile for a sore throat. ",
            "There is undoubtedly a larger issue that needs to be addressed -- how the government can balance tradition with safer regulations. ",
            "But the beliefs and customs that drive consumption of these foods are centuries old and interwoven in peoples' lives -- they are not so easy to undo, even less so when they are dismissed as primitive and unclean by foreign countries.",
            "'Standing with our Chinese community' ",
            "Right now, we are only seeing early signs of a xenophobic backlash against the East Asian diaspora -- tasteless jokes online, bad headlines, people acting fearfully in public. But if the 2003 SARS epidemic is any model to go by, these strands of xenophobia could potentially escalate into more dangerous, explicit forms of racism.",
            "At the peak of the 2003 outbreak, people of Asian descent were treated like pariahs in the West. There were reports of white people covering their faces in the presence of Asian coworkers, and real estate agents who were told not to serve Asian clients. ",
            "Asian people suffered threats of eviction, had job offers rescinded with no explanation, and some Asian Canadian organizations received outright hate messages. Chinese and Asian businesses suffered heavy losses; in Boston, an April Fool's hoax falsely warned of infected employees at a Chinese restaurant, reportedly causing a 70% drop in the restaurant's business.",
            "This all happened 17 years ago, when China was still slowly opening up. Now it's an emerging superpower, and its role in a range of recent conflicts -- the ongoing US-China trade war, security concerns surrounding telecommunications company Huawei, allegations of Chinese spies in America and Australia -- mean that many in the West already view China with greater suspicion and tension than they did before.",
            "Add the threat of a global pandemic, and a wave of heightened discrimination could be even uglier this time around.",
            "Diaspora communities and local authorities are preparing for this, with many trying to calm fear before it becomes hysteria. In France, the newspaper controversy sparked a social media campaign, with many French Chinese citizens using the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus -- I am not a virus.",
            "In a statement confirming the first case of coronavirus in Los Angeles this week, the local health department stressed that \"people should not be excluded from activities based on their race, country of origin, or recent travel if they do not have symptoms of respiratory illness.\"",

A Hong Kong government statement said it \"appealed to other employers to make flexible work arrangements for employees in order to reduce contacts among people.\" ",
            "Schools in many of these places have been suspended -- so teachers are instead conducting classes through digital learning tools, such as Google Hangouts and other video conferencing software. One Hong Kong school requires students to \"check in\" digitally and do lesson tasks online with hourly deadlines, so if students skip a class, it leaves a digital record.",

            "\"Before (the epidemic) happened, we were not really keen on letting our team work from home because we value collaboration,\" said Lamarque. \"But this experience actually showed us that the whole team collaborates quite well even if they're not in the same room, so we're looking at adding that into our employee benefits ... maybe two to three weeks a year.\"",
            "However, he admitted that a big part of the work-from-home success owed to the digital nature of their company and industry -- employees only require a computer and internet connection, meaning they can work from anywhere. ",
            "Joe Hasberry, a Hong Kong employee at an asset management firm, has also been working from home -- but unlike Lamarque, he and other coworkers will be returning to the office next week. The company needs to meet with clients and visitors, meaning it's hard to keep working from home beyond a few weeks.",

            "The past decade has seen expanding opportunities for remote working and increasing remote job listings -- and this shift is largely due to new technologies and changing family demographics.",
            "The movement has been embraced by many parents who say the ability to work from home makes it easier to juggle childcare and a career. Many families who can't afford nannies or day care face a difficult decision when they have a baby, with one of the parents -- often the woman -- having to sacrifice career advancement to care for their child. ",
            "The option to work from home doesn't just empower women -- it makes it easier for working fathers to step into that role too, in a step toward gender equality that benefits all parties.",

            "She acknowledged that the current work-from-home situation in Hong Kong has produced \"extra challenges which are out of our control\" -- for instance, working parents have to care for children whose classes have been suspended. Homes that are empty, quiet, and perfect for remote working on a typical day are now filled with people and distractions. ",
            "But these are extraordinary circumstances -- not the norm, she said. Current challenges don't mean that working from home is ineffective, or that it shouldn't be implemented more widely beyond the outbreak.",

Coast Guard personnel are also doing the work at some airports. ",
            "Cuccinelli said the \"very small number of people who have either traveled to Hubei province or show symptoms\" will go to a third screening.

            "If Beijing fails to contain the disease quickly, it will cause more pain for a country that was already trying to stave off a serious downturn by trying to encourage more consumer spending. An epidemic could have the opposite effect. ",

            "The world's second biggest economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades last year as it contended with rising debt, cooling domestic demand and US tariffs, many of which remain in place despite a recent truce. Beijing is worried about unemployment, too, and has announced a wave of stimulus measures in recent weeks aimed at preventing mass layoffs.",
            "Most of the tariffs Washington imposed on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods haven't gone away, said ING economist Robert Carnell, adding that Beijing has already nudged \"every policy lever that could be nudged\" to try to offset the effects of the trade dispute. ",
            "The Chinese economy is just \"managing\" right now, he said.",
            "Wright called the timing of the outbreak \"especially unfortunate\" given the Lunar New Year holiday. The period is the largest annual human migration on Earth, during which hundreds of millions of Chinese travelers usually cram themselves into homebound trains, buses and planes for family reunions.  ",
            "The spread of the virus prompted Chinese officials to take the largely unprecedented step of partially locking down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China where the virus originated. Airline regulators have also instructed Chinese carriers to offer free cancellations on flights into Wuhan, while state media has reported that China's rail authorities are taking similar steps.",
            "A SARS-like scenario",
            "China has a good sense of the economic trouble that could lie ahead.",
            "The 2003 SARS outbreak, which sickened 8,098 and killed 774 people in 37 different countries, cost the world economy $40 billion, according to a study from the National Institutes of Health. The economies of China and Hong Kong bore the brunt of that burden, the authors said.  ",
            "Like SARS, the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak could spark widespread fear and spur people to hunker down and avoid going outside. That kind of behavior would deal a huge blow to the service sector, which now accounts for about 52% of the Chinese economy.",
            "\"As soon as you're worried, you're worried,\" Carnell said. \"You stay home, if you can. You don't go out to the local food court, you try not to travel on public transport, you try to work from home, you don't travel for pleasure. You don't get on a plane, you don't go to the movie theater, restaurants or conferences.\"",
            "The SARS outbreak forced the cancellation of the week-long May Day holiday in China, forced the postponement or abandonment of sporting, business and cultural events and turned Beijing into a virtual ghost town. ",
            "Investors are already worried about what the Wuhan virus could mean for China's growing travel industry. Shares of the country's three major airlines \u2014 Air China, China Southern and China Eastern \u2014 all closed down 2.5% or more in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Thursday. And the aviation sector is \"likely to remain under pressure as confirmed cases are set to increase,\" said Andrew Lee, equity analyst at Jefferies.",
            "SARS also had a wider impact on the economy. China's annual growth rate slumped to 9.1% in the second quarter of 2003, down from 11.1% in the first quarter of that year, according to brokerage firm Macquarie Group. ",
            "This time around, the hit to China's GDP could be even worse, because the sectors most directly affected now make up a bigger part of the economy, Commerzbank analyst Hao Zhou and economist Marco Wagner wrote in a research note on Wednesday. For example, tourism accounts for about 5% of China's GDP today, compared to 2% in 2003. ",
            "\"If history is a guide, there is clearly a risk that the already struggling China's consumption would face further headwinds if the (Wuhan) virus can't be effectively controlled,\" Hao and Wagner wrote. ",
            "Limiting the economic blow",
            "But China is stepping up efforts to contain the virus, including the partial lockdown of Wuhan, and some lessons have been learned since 2003, when the authorities were slow to release information and initially downplayed the severity of the SARS outbreak.",
            "\"Rumors and bad information were drowning out good information at that time, and people were especially careful as a result,\" said Wright, adding that he expected the economic impact of the Wuhan virus won't be as severe as during the SARS crisis. ",
            "And as scary as the 2003 outbreak was, experts say the impact on China's economy was short-lived. ",
            "Once SARS faded away, China's growth rebounded quickly and climbed to 10% in the third quarter of 2003, according to Commerzbank's Hao and Wagner. ",

A senior US State Department official, for example, said Wednesday that the United States is concerned about transparency inside the Chinese government about the Wuhan coronovirus.

            "He said there have been many examples in the past where problems like a fire or natural disaster shutting a single supplier plant can affect auto plants around the world. This could be far worse depending on how widespread the shutdown of plants due to the virus becomes.",
            "China is a major supplier of parts to auto plants around the world -- shipping nearly $35 billion of parts in 2018, according to UN data. About $20 billion of Chinese parts were exported to the United States alone in 2018, according to the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration. While some of those parts go to auto parts retail stores, a large percentage of them go to assembly lines and are to used to build cars.",
            "And experts say the parts at risk are likely greater than that, since many Chinese parts, from computer chips down to screws and bolts, are not classified simply as auto parts the way a bumper or engine piston is classified that way. Also Chinese parts often end up being used in auto parts that are built in other countries.",
            "Finding replacements for all those parts is not practical if the supply continues to be disrupted, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank.",
            "\"It's difficult to say when it will start to bite here,\" she said. \"I would expect to see a cascading global impact by the end of February if Chinese production doesn't come back [this week]. All automakers have a supply chain war room going on right now to determine what they can be doing. But China is so huge, there is no way they cannot be impacted.\"",
            "So far most of the auto assembly plants in China are closed, and they're there to serve the Chinese market. Volkswagen announced it was keeping its Chinese auto plants shut partly due to travel restrictions there and partly due to the lack of parts. General Motors said it won't restart its Chinese plants until Feb. 15, partly due to problems with \"supply chain readiness.\"",
            "But it has already started to spread to plants elsewhere. Hyundai has shut its assembly plants in South Korea, not because the disease itself has spread there but because it can't keep the plants operating without Chinese parts. Nissan said that its plant in Kyushu, Japan would have \"production adjustments\" due to a shortage of Chinese parts. French automaker Renault told Reuters that it also was suspending production at a plant in Busan, South Korea, due to disruptions in supplies of Chinese parts. Last week, Fiat Chrysler said it has one European plant at risk from the lack of Chinese parts in the next two to four weeks. ",
            "All the other automakers will say they are closely monitoring the situation in China but that it's too soon to say what the impact on their global operations will be.",
            "\"It's a very fluid situation,\" said GM CEO Mary Barra last week when speaking to investors.",
            "Experts say the global auto industry hasn't seen the full impact before now because the plants had been scheduled to closed for the lunar new year. So many assembly plants had an extra inventory of parts going into the holiday. While the shutdown was extended by a week due to the outbreak, most plants haven't run out of Chinese parts yet. But that can't last.",
            "The prospect of widespread halts at global auto plants becomes a lot more likely if the plant shutdowns continue, said Simon MacAdam global economist at Capital Economics in London. ",
            "\"At the moment it's rather difficult to tell,\" he said. \"A supply chain is only as strong as the weakest link. That's why there's such uncertainty about estimates.\" ",
            "Even if the plants try to reopen, it's not clear if they'll be able to operate as normal due to potential labor shortages, or in the worst case scenario, a further spreading of the disease, said Dunne. And getting the parts shipped won't be business as usual. ",
            "\"They're supposed to start getting back to work Monday,\" said Dunne. \"But even then, it will be a start-stop. Some cities will have road blocks, some won't have flights. We're going to be in for an interesting time starting this week.\"",

            "\"Right now, there's no evidence that [wearing face masks] is going to help prevent that infection,\" Chiu, a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told CNN. \"I would not recommend that someone in the US who does not have direct exposure, did not recently travel to China...or in general that you go buy a face mask.\" ",

Surgical masks aren't considered respiratory protection by the CDC because they don't filter smaller particles, and therefore isn't effective in totally preventing coronavirus transmission. ",
            "\"Wearing a surgical mask helps you prevent sharing your germs if you're sick,\" Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist and infection prevention expert, told CNN. \"Surgical masks do not seal around the face, so while they offer some protection, it's the N95 mask that offers the most protection.\"",

            "In the case of SARS, another type of coronavirus, a large amount of infections originated in hospitals among healthcare workers treating infected people, Chiu said. So now, doctors follow the same strict precautions and wear gowns, gloves, N95 respirators and goggles to reduce their likelihood of infection.",
            "So unless you're treating a patient with the coronavirus, the N95 respirator isn't necessary, he said. ",
            "Another reason not to wear an N95 mask: Physicians are also regularly fitted for the N95 respirators, and there's a proper way to wear them to ensure there's no open space and the mask fits snugly against the face. People with no medical training might wear it incorrectly, Popescu said. ",
            "Plus, Chiu said, N95 respirators are \"quite uncomfortable\" to wear for long periods of time -- and taking it off negates the effects of wearing it. ",
            "Masks could give wearers a false sense of security",
            "In China's Heibo Province where the coronavirus is thought to be actively spreading, surgical masks aren't a fail-safe, but they're \"better than nothing,\" Popescu said.",
            "But in the US, Chiu said, wearing a mask could give wearers a \"false sense of security,\" he said: If concerned people wear a surgical mask, usually made out of thin fabric or paper, they may not continually wash their hands or fear contact with infected people. ",
            "\"That's really not the nature of transmission,\" he said. \"That's thought to be contact transmission -- touching infected surfaces, touching the eyes and nose.\" ",

            "Now, as the region grapples with another deadly virus, authorities in Australia are trying to avoid a repeat of 2003's fearmongering. ",
            "Last week Anthony Albanese, leader of Australia's Labor Party, said in parliament that Chinese-Australians have been targeted as a result of the outbreak, Seven News reported.",
            "\"The fact is any racist behavior will not be tolerated and it must be called out,\" he said. \"All of us must stand up and speak out against the ugly, divisive and racist behavior which has been directed to some of our fellow Australians.\"",

            "Wuhan, China (CNN)The Lunar New Year -- the most important festival in the Chinese calendar -- is just three days away, but in the Chinese city of Wuhan, there are few reasons to celebrate.",
            "A deadly outbreak of the new coronavirus emerged in this city of 11 million people last month. Within weeks, the virus has killed nine people, sickened hundreds and spread as far as the United States.",
            "Wuhan has been on high alert since the number of confirmed infections surged into the hundreds earlier this week.  ",
            "New year celebrations that had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people have been canceled. In some parts of the city, including a major shopping area, streets remain largely empty, with most people walking outside donning face masks. ",
            "In the city's center, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market sits empty, its rows of stalls shuttered. Police and security officers in face masks stand guard outside, prohibiting anyone from filming or entering a cordoned off area. ",
            "The market has always been a popular spot at this time of the year, packed with shoppers stocking up on fish and seafood for Lunar New Year feasts with family and friends. ",
            "But this year, Chinese authorities and scientists say wild animals sold at this market are the likely source of the new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). ",
            "The virus -- which can infect humans and animals -- has since spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Officials in Washington state confirmed the first case on US soil Tuesday. ",
            "The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection, but health authorities have not found out which animals are the source.",
            "'How can I not be worried?'",
            "Not far from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Xiao Chuan'an, from a neighboring city, is selling sugar cane she imported from southern Guangdong province. ",
            "\"I do feel a bit scared,\" she told CNN. \"How can I not be worried? The situation sounds really serious. The news on the phone sounds really scary.\"",
            "The country's National Health Commission confirmed this week the virus can be transmitted between people, after Wuhan health authorities maintained for two weeks that there was \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.\"",
            "In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, 270 people have been infected as of Wednesday, and nine of them have died, according to the commission. At least 453 cases had been confirmed throughout China, leading to fears of a possible epidemic. ",
            "Xiao said her family had repeatedly urged her to go home, fearing that she will catch the virus in Wuhan. But she wants to stay to sell the sugar cane. However, business has been bad -- people are too scared to come to the market to shop, she said. ",
            "\"You can see now -- does it look like the atmosphere of Chinese New Year?\" she said. \"I don't know when the pneumonia epidemic will stop... I might have to eat instant noodles during Chinese New Year.\"",
            "Emergency measures ",
            "The city government announced a series of new measures Tuesday to contain the outbreak -- efforts some critics say came too late  -- the virus has already spread to a dozen provinces across the country.",
            "Tour agencies in Wuhan have been banned from taking groups out of the city. Infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.",
            "The city has over 60 routes connecting Wuhan with international cities, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. It is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network.",
            "At the high-speed rail station, the only faces that stand out are the uncovered ones, with the vast majority of passengers donning masks. As they prepare to exit the station, a railway staff member -- also wearing a mask and gloves -- puts a thermometer at the head of each passenger, checking for a fever.",
            "On a high speed train from Beijing to Wuhan, railway attendants and security guards left their faces uncovered. A train attendant told CNN they were asked by management not to wear masks, as it may trigger a panic among passengers.",
            "But she added that the train company is preparing to purchase masks and they will begin wearing them should the situation worsen.",
            "Some hotels in the city said they will also screen guests, checking their temperature and asking them to sanitize their hands upon entry.",
            "On Wednesday, the general manager of the Westin hotel in Wuhan told CNN he had asked staff to start wearing face masks \"for both their safety and for the safety of our guests.\"",
            "Others, however, are less worried about the outbreak. Yan Weixi, a jackfruit seller who did not wear a mask, said she did not find the situation \"so scary.\"",
            "\"I have been checking online instructions... like drinking more water or washing your hands more frequently. I think that should be fine,\" said Yan, from northeastern Heilongjiang province, who is spending her first Lunar New Year in Wuhan.",

            "Hong Kong (CNN)As the deadly novel coronavirus spread throughout China and the world last month, it was clear that something had gone wrong. ",
            "Officials in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, were blamed for downplaying -- and potentially even deliberately covering up -- the severity of the virus, ignoring evidence that it spread from person-to-person until it was too late. ",
            "Against this tale of irresponsibility there was another story being told in China, one of a competent central government which had been denied the full picture by local officials, and once it understood the true ramifications stepped in to take drastic action to stop the virus' spread. ",
            "And indeed, there was a major shift on January 20, when Chinese President Xi Jinping commented publicly for the first time on the virus, and ordered \"resolute efforts\" to control the outbreak. Speaking alongside Xi in Beijing a week later, World Health Organization (WHO) director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the \"seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak,\" and thanked Beijing for its \"transparency.\" ",
            "Over the weekend, however, a transcript of an internal Communist Party speech appeared to throw doubt on this narrative, revealing Xi knew about and was directing the response to the virus on January 7 -- almost two weeks before he commented on it publicly. ",
            "The revelation raises major questions about whether it was the central government, not authorities in Hubei, who dithered on their response, allowing the virus to spread through the country and eventually the world.",
            "It also underlines the difficulty in maintaining Xi's image -- carefully cultivated by state media -- as an almost omniscient ruler who oversees, and is aware of everything that is happening in the country. With criticism growing of the failure to contain the coronavirus, both at home and abroad, Beijing was faced with either choosing to admit that Xi was ignorant of the true nature of the crisis until almost a month into it, or that he was aware of it and involved in the response.",
            "By choosing the latter option, however, no matter how much blame can be placed onto provincial officials for failing to \"implement\" Xi's instructions, the government is admitting that ultimate responsibility for the outbreak lies with the man at the center. ",
            "Who knew?",
            "In the transcript of the speech, published Saturday by the official Communist Party journal Qiushi, Xi \"issued requirements for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus\" during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's most powerful decision making body on January 7. ",
            "He gave further instructions on January 20 and two days later, when he \"explicitly requested Hubei province to implement comprehensive and strict control over the outflow of people\" -- essentially placing the province on lockdown. ",
            "\"I have, at all times, monitored the spread of the epidemic and the progress in prevention and control work, and continue to give oral orders and instructions,\" Xi is reported to have said.",
            "It is the 13-day period between January 7 and 20 that is most crucial, not least because it is when officials in Hubei held two key provincial Party meetings and Wuhan invited more than 40,000 families to attend a mass banquet in an attempt to set a world record. It's also when officials in both Wuhan and Hubei appeared to downplay the outbreak, an assessment that was repeated by state officials: Wang Guangfa, head of a team of researchers sent from Beijing to investigate the situation, said on January 11 that it was under control. ",
            "Wang, like others on the front line during the initial outbreak, was subsequently diagnosed with the virus.",
            "Provincial officials have faced intense criticism for their handling of the crisis during this period, coming as it did in the run up to the Lunar New Year travel period, in which hundreds of millions of people criss-cross the country. Passenger screening was not put in place in Wuhan -- itself a major international and domestic travel hub -- until January 14 and further restrictions over a week later. ",
            "Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang later admitted that the city's \"warnings were not sufficient,\" and offered to resign. ",
            "\"We understand that the public is unsatisfied with our information disclosure. On one hand, we failed to disclose relevant information in a timely manner; on the other, we did not make sufficient use of valid information to improve our work,\" Zhou said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV. \"As for the late disclosure, I hope the public can understand that it's an infectious disease, and relevant information should be released according to the law. As a local government, we can only disclose information after being authorized.\"",
            "Zhou's reference to being authorized to release information was initially seen as something of an attempt to cover his own back, by pushing some of the responsibility onto his superiors. But if Xi was directing the response at this point, then Zhou may have indeed been waiting for guidance from Beijing before he did anything, and any blame for his inaction may lie elsewhere. ",
            "Xi at the center",
            "Wu Qiang, a Beijing-based political analyst who specializes in analyzing Xi's speeches, described the recently published address as \"unprecedented\" during an interview with the South China Morning Post. \"It sounds like he is defending and explaining how he has done everything in his capacity to lead epidemic prevention,\" said Wu.",
            "In recent weeks, there has been an apparent effort to push any blame for the crisis onto provincial officials, who either misled Beijing or failed to implement the Party leadership's instructions. This was exemplified by China's ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, who said in an interview with NPR on Saturday that \"you cannot talk in very general terms 'the government' (in China).\" ",
            "\"Sometimes government at a particular level makes some mistakes. This is possible. This is, I think it is all natural all over the world,\" he said. \"But you cannot say the whole government in China is making a mistake. This is not true.\" ",
            "This was already something of an awkward narrative for Xi, who has amassed more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong and severely ramped up internal discipline within the Communist Party. By emphasizing his personal involvement in the response from an early stage, Xi has potentially undermined that narrative even further -- you can't blame local officials for their failures, and then reveal you were watching them the entire time. ",
            "Ultimately, however, the awkwardness of sharing some of the blame with Hubei officials might be preferable than admitting that Xi and those around him were potentially unaware or ill informed about what was really going on.",

This means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients.

            "What we know about the virus",
            "First identified in Wuhan in mid-December, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is in the same family of infections as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).",
            "Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city which was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species. SARS was previously linked to similar markets, particularly the sale of civet cats, a delicacy in some parts of China. ",
            "Speaking Wednesday, Li, the Chinese health official, said that Wuhan and Hubei provincial authorities should tighten the regulation of farm markets and wild animals. He also urged the public to avoid crowds and minimize large gatherings. ",
            "Chinese health officials said human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed, raising the chance of its spread. In one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient unknown to be carrying the virus were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily. ",
            "People were seen at a train station Wednesday trying to get train tickets to leave Wuhan.",
            "The true extent of the virus is unclear, and official figures may be an underestimation. A study by British researchers previously estimated -- based on the spread of the virus overseas in a relatively short time -- that the number of people infected in Wuhan alone was likely around 1,700. ",
            "However, so far the death toll is relatively low, and almost all cases involved elderly people with preexisting conditions: of the more than 400 confirmed cases in China, nine deaths have been reported so far, or 2.25%. By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of around 10%, and was even more deadly among vulnerable populations. ",
            "Worldwide effort",
            "With cases and suspected cases already reported across Asia and now as far afield as the US and Australia, containment efforts are being put in place in many travel hubs.",
            "Wuhan alone has connections with more than 60 overseas destinations through its international airport, while Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, all of which have reported cases, have hundreds more. ",
            "Airports across Asia have stepped up temperature screening of incoming passengers, as have several hubs in the US, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
            "Officials at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport put up signs at the international arrivals area instructing travelers from Wuhan to watch for symptoms of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started displaying the sign in English and Chinese on January 14, an airport spokesman said. ",
            "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a statement saying it was closely monitoring developments and is actively working with the WHO secretariat, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the CDC. ",

It also raises questions about his capacity to lead in a time of crisis in which he has often seemed most concerned about downplaying the situation, stoking stock markets and minimizing the political impact of the virus in an election year.",
            "Last week, the President falsely blamed the Obama administration for slowing the development of coronavirus test kits and cited poll numbers that he said showed wide public support for his leadership that were more than two weeks old. He claimed Friday to have \"stopped\" the virus.",
            "From the Mueller investigation to the impeachment drama, Trump has succeeded in fogging accusations of wrongdoing or administration failures and attacked the institutions that hold him accountable like Congress and the press. He is also an expert at sowing narratives that his conservative media cheerleaders seize upon to build political pressure that ensures that Republican lawmakers pay a price for criticizing him.",
            "But the widening impact of the coronavirus drama, the constantly rising numbers of infections and the hammering taken by US stocks in recent days are casting constant doubt on the credibility of the President's assurances. Whether he will end up paying a political price for the gap between rhetoric and reality -- that would begin to erode the remarkable resilience of Trump's standing with GOP voters -- remains to be seen.",
            "Hopefully, the epidemic will not be severe and will soon pass. But a botched handling of a more serious crisis would be sure to damage a conventional President and it would test even Trump's capacity to shake it off and win reelection.",

            "The concrete information needed to stem public concern and to help local authorities get a grip on the epidemic still seems hard to come by from top administration officials.",

            "\"The numbers are tough because they're changing minute by minute,\" he said when asked how many people had been tested.",
            "Adams said that currently there were 75,000 kits available -- a number that should grow to two million by Monday and four million by the end of the week.",
            "The President's breezy assessments increasingly do not mirror those of scientists and experts within his administration.",
            "\"I think we're getting a better sense as the days go by,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday when asked for his evaluation of the impact of the virus.",
            "\"Unfortunately, that better sense is not encouraging because we're seeing community spread, and whenever you see community spread, you can do contact tracing, but as more community spread it becomes logistically more difficult,\" Fauci said.",
            "On \"Fox News Sunday,\" Fauci was asked whether it could become necessary to quarantine entire cities, like Seattle, after Italy took steps to isolate its hard-hit northern region.",
            "\"It's possible,\" Fauci said.",
            "\"You know, you don't want to alarm people, but given the spread we see, you know, anything is possible. And that's the reason why we've got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak.\"",
            "The President's repeated claims that everything is under control are being contradicted by the rapid spread of the disease across the country and continuing uncertainty over the availability of testing kits needed by state and local medical authorities.",
            "Last Monday morning, ahead of a week packed with conflicting messages, misplaced optimism and obfuscation by the President, the tally of US cases stood at 89. The disease has now spread into 34 states and the District of Columbia, at least 565 cases have been confirmed and at least 22 people have died. Eight states have declared states of emergency. The real number of infections may be much higher, but the true extent of the crisis was disguised by delays and malfunctions in coronavirus testing that suggest the administration squandered valuable time as the virus ravaged China to properly prepare for its US arrival.",

            "US oil tumbled another 2.8% on Monday and briefly broke below $50 a barrel for the first time since January 2019. Crude finished at $50.11 a barrel, leaving it down nearly 21% from the recent closing high of $63.27 a barrel on January 6. A bear market is frequently defined as a drop of more than 20% from previous highs. ",
            "Energy markets have been clobbered by the rapid spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 360 people and infected more than 17,000 around the world. The virus has also caused countless flight cancellations and brought parts of the Chinese economy to a standstill.  ",

Major international airlines including Air Canada, American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL) and British Airways have suspended all flights to and from mainland China until the end of February or longer. China Eastern on Monday became the first major Chinese carrier to suspend flights to and from the United States. ",
            "The coronavirus has alarmed investors because it's spreading rapidly in China, the most important source of demand for energy in the world. China relies on heavy amounts of oil to keep its fast-growing economy humming and to move its enormous population.  ",

            " (CNN)A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans. ",
            "\"What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals,\" Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, said. ",
            "It's not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be, but fatality rates are currently lower than both MERS and SARS. Experts stress that it will change as the outbreak develops.",
            "The World Health Organization offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including how to monitor for the sick and how to treat patients. Here's what you should know about coronaviruses. ",
            "What is a coronavirus?",
            "Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "Coronavirus symptoms",
            "The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.",
            "For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis. ",
            "There are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly.",
            "Middle East respiratory syndrome, also known as the MERS virus, was first reported in the Middle East in 2012 and also causes respiratory problems, but those symptoms are much more severe. Three to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms. First identified in the Guangdong province in southern China, according to the WHO, it causes respiratory problems but can also cause diarrhea, fatigue, shortness of breath, respiratory distress and kidney failure. Depending on the patient's age, the death rate with SARS ranged from 0-50% of the cases, with older people being the most vulnerable.",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus is currently thought to be more mild than SARS and MERS and takes longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit the hospital, explains Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford. So far, around 15% to 20% of cases have become severe, requiring, for example, ventilation in the hospital.",
            "How it spreads",
            "Viruses can spread from human contact with animals. Scientists think MERS started in camels, according to the WHO. With SARS, scientists suspected civet cats were to blame. Officials do not yet know what animal may have caused the current outbreak in Wuhan.",
            "When it comes to human-to-human transmission of the viruses, often it happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough. ",
            "Depending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient's waste, according to the CDC.",
            "Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the Wuhan coronavirus, but experts are now trying to understand who is transmitting it most, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community. SARS and MERS were largely transmitted inside hospitals, Horby said. Some people are also considered to be \"superspreaders.\"",
            "Who is affected?",
            "MERS, SARS and the Wuhan coronavirus appear to cause more severe disease in older people, though uncertainty remains around the latest outbreak. Of the cases of Wuhan coronavirus reported so far, none are yet confirmed to be among children, Horby said. The average age is people 40 or over, he said.  ",
            "Coronavirus treatment",
            "There is no specific treatment, but research is underway. Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor. ",
            "Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough. ",
            "Drink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible.",
            "Should you worry about the Wuhan coronavirus?",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus fatality rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, but still comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, explains  Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London.",
            "\"It is a significant concern, globally,\" Ferguson says, noting that we don't fully understand the severity. ",
            "Ferguson believes the fatality rate is likely to be lower due to an \"iceberg\" of milder cases we are yet to find, but he highlights that novel viruses spread much faster through a population. ",
            "How can you can prevent it?",
            "There is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses, at least not yet. Trials for a MERS vaccine are underway. The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus, but it will be months until clinical trials get underway and more than a year until it might become available. ",
            "You may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds.",
            "Awareness is key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be the Wuhan coronavirus due to travel to the region or coming into contact with someone who has been there, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.",
            "Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.",
            "If traveling to China, be aware of symptoms and avoid live animal markets, which is where the latest outbreak began in Wuhan.",
            "Coronavirus and pregnancy",
            "In pregnant women, the more severe versions of MERS and SARS coronaviruses can be serious. There are cases in which a woman infected with MERS had a stillbirth, a 2014 study showed. ",
            "SARS-associated illnesses were linked to cases of spontaneous abortion, maternal death and critical maternal illness, a 2004 study found.",
            "Coronavirus and cats, dogs and other animals",
            "Pets can catch coronaviruses and the infections can become severe. Sometimes the viruses can lead to deadly diseases. One can cause feline infectious peritonitis in cats and something called a pantropic canine coronavirus can infect cats and dogs, according to a 2011 study. ",
            "Cats can catch SARS, but none of the infected cats developed symptoms, according to the study. The feline coronavirus typically is asymptomatic, but can cause mild diarrhea. Feline infectious peritonitis, or FIP, can cause flu-like symptoms for a cat, but can also be more serious for cats and can cause organ failure, but it is not contagious and will not spread from animal to animal or person to person.",
            "Pantropic canine coronavirus that can impact cats and dogs can be fatal to dogs, studies show.",
            "These particular dog and cat viruses don't seem to spread to humans.",

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.",
            " (CNN)A study published Friday in the medical journal JAMA found that 41% of the first 138 patients diagnosed at one hospital in Wuhan, China, were presumed to be infected in that hospital.",
            "This is big news. In plain English, it means that nearly half of the initial infections in this hospital appear to have been spread within the hospital itself. This is called nosocomial transmission. (Doctors use big words to hide bad things: Nosocomial means caught it in the hospital.)",
            "What's more, most spread doesn't appear to have been the result of a so-called \"super-spreader event,\" in which a single patient transmits infection to many other people. In these events, a procedure such as bronchoscopy -- where a doctor inserts a tube into the patient's lungs -- can result in many infections. ",
            "This would be a concern, but not nearly as much as what appears to have happened: Many health care workers and many patients got infected in many parts of the hospital. What's more, since there's a broad spectrum of infection and only patients who were sick were tested, it's quite likely that there was even more transmission in the hospital.",
            "So, like SARS and MERS -- other coronaviruses -- before it, the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading in hospitals.",
            "What does this mean?",
            "The virus appears to be quite infectious, health care workers are at especially high risk, and we urgently need more information about just how infectious the virus is. The virus might well be impossible to contain -- just as the common cold and influenza can't be stopped, but the health and societal impacts can be blunted.",
            "China's extraordinary efforts to stop the spread of the virus, even if unsuccessful, may slow its spread and improve China and the world's ability to limit the harm the virus causes.",
            "What do we need to do now?",
            "We must protect health care workers and others who care for sick people. This is done through a hierarchy of controls: source, engineering, administrative and personal.",
            "Source controls include encouraging patients who are only mildly ill to not expose others; requiring all people who are ill to wear face masks; limiting hospital attendance by visitors who may be infectious; ensuring that ill health care workers don't work; and minimizing the number -- and ensuring the safety of -- risky procedures such as bronchoscopy and sputum induction, by performing them only in isolation rooms.",
            "Engineering controls include putting partitions in triage areas, making sure potentially contaminated air is not recirculated and surfaces are cleaned meticulously, and implementing additional precautions for suspected cases.",
            "Administrative controls include asking all patients if they have symptoms and taking their temperatures; requiring those with cough or fever to wear a face mask, and isolating them from others at least by several feet until they are more thoroughly assessed. It's especially important to recognize all potentially infectious patients quickly and to implement strict infection control procedures and early in all areas of all health care facilities.",
            "Personal controls include hand washing and respiratory hygiene. But mask use by the general public -- people without symptoms who are not caring for others -- has little or no benefit and potentially great harm if people who need masks can't get them. Masks will be in short supply. The most important use is for health care workers and those caring for ill patients. In health care settings, safely reusable respiratory protection that can be disinfected can be crucially important. Useful products include personal air-purifying devices and elastomeric respirators. Patients also must be able to cover their mouths to reduce spread of infection.",
            "What more do we need to know?",
            "We are learning more, but unfortunately, the answer is, a lot.",
            "China has been working hard to keep up with the testing, care and social impacts of the virus. It's good to see crucial epidemiological information starting to emerge.",
            "We still don't know the basics about who has been tested, what proportion are positive, how this is changing over time, and what the positivity rates are by location, week of testing and patient age. This is basic information. As just one example: How many children have been tested? Does the fact that there have been few infections in children reflect a lack of testing or a lack of infection?",
            "Among those who test positive, what proportion do and don't develop severe disease, analyzed by age, sex and underlying medical conditions? What proportion die, analyzed by the same factors?",
            "Among all patients using selected health facilities in Wuhan and elsewhere, what proportion of those with a cough have infection, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples? What proportion of those without a cough have novel coronavirus infection confirmed by PCR testing?",
            "The answers to these questions will help determine whether the virus is already circulating widely (i.e., has become endemic and can't be stopped), what proportion of all with infection have serious illness, and whether the epidemic is peaking or not.",
            "Where is the novel coronavirus going next?",
            "Only time will tell. The next few days and weeks will determine:",
            "If sustained transmission begins in other countries, which unfortunately seems likely.If it does, whether it can be contained, which unfortunately seems unlikely.How severe the illness is among those who are infected, which we still don't know.",

            "Volkswagen (VLKAF), Toyota (TM), Daimler (DDAIF), General Motors (GM), Renault (RNLSY), Honda (HMC) and Hyundai (HYMTF) are among the global carmakers who have invested heavily in China, forming partnerships with local companies and building vast factories. China makes more cars than any other country, and is also the world's biggest market. ",
            "When car plants across China shut last month for the Lunar New Year holiday, the industry was already under huge pressure: sales had been falling for two years due to the loss of tax incentives for electric cars and the slowing economy, and officials were expecting an unprecedented third year of stagnation. ",
            "Many of those plants have since been ordered to remain shut at least until next week as the Chinese government scrambles to contain the virus that first appeared in Wuhan, a major autos hub, before sweeping across the country, infecting thousands of people and killing hundreds. Automakers are bracing for even longer shutdowns and a deeper recession in global sales.",
            "Sales and production to suffer",
            "Close to 60 million people are still living under lockdown in China, with three cities reporting over a thousand confirmed coronavirus cases each. Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread, keeping huge numbers of potential shoppers at home until the outbreak peaks.",

            "The extended factory closures are expected to make it much more difficult for the industry to emerge from its recession. According to S&P Global Ratings, the outbreak will force carmakers in China to slash production by about 15% in the first quarter.",
            "The auto industry is particularly exposed because the virus originated in one of China's \"motor cities.\" General Motors, Nissan (NSANF), Renault, Honda and Peugeot owner PSA Group (PUGOY) all have large factories in Wuhan, which has been on lockdown since late January. ",

            "\"The situation varies depending on the plant and its supply of parts. Also, there are additional considerations that must be given to the guidelines from local and region governments, including things like logistics, so we cannot definitively say whether we will restart plant operations from February 17,\" a Toyota spokesperson said.",
            "The situation could get worse before it gets better. S&P Global Ratings researchers said the Chinese government could extend factory shutdowns in order to limit contagion risk, affecting as much as half of China's car and auto parts production. Car plants in cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin \u2014 many hundreds of miles away from Wuhan \u2014 could be out of commission for an \"extended\" period, they warned.",

            "\"Now is the time for US businesses, hospitals, and communities to begin preparing for the possible spread of #COVID19,\" it wrote, referring to the name the World Health Organization has given the novel coronavirus. \"CDC continues to work with business, education & healthcare sectors, encouraging employers to be prepared.\"",
            "Live updates from around the world",
            "Messonnier said her agency wants people to understand their lives might be disrupted.",
            "\"We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad,\" she said.",
            "She said CDC officials have been saying for weeks that while they hope the spread won't be severe in the United States, they are planning as if it could be.",
            "\"The data over the last week, and the spread in other countries, has certainly raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation\" of community spread, she said.",
            "The CDC still doesn't know what that will look like, she added. Community spread could be reasonably mild or very severe. ",
            "Americans should also talk to employers about working online and talk to doctor's offices about telehealth, the CDC says.",
            "Messonnier said she talked her family and told them that while they are not at risk right now, they should plan for what to do if their lives were significanly impacted. She said she called the children's school district about what would happen if schools need to close. ",
            "US cases up",
            "Also Tuesday, the agency said the number of cases in the United States has risen to 57, with four more patients who were on a cruise ship.",
            "While in India, President Donald Trump cast coronavirus as \"a problem that's going to go away,\" but experts worry a pandemic could be in the offing, given the virus' spread in Europe and the Middle East. ",
            "The CDC is employing a twofold approach, working to contain the virus while also implementing strategies to lessen the impacts on communities, Messonnier told reporters. ",
            "\"We've also enacted the first quarantine of this scale in the US, and are supporting the State Department and (Department of Health and Human Services) in repatriating citizens from high-risk areas,\" she said. ",
            "In addition, the center is tracking and isolating cases when it can, issuing travel advisories for affected countries and taking on the increasingly difficult task of preventing the introduction of new cases, most notably at points of entry into the United States, she said.",
            "Messonnier described the containment strategies as \"largely successful\" and said they were geared toward \"buying us more time to prepare.\"",

            "The current total breaks down to 40 passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was traveling in Asia, three people repatriated from China, and 14 US cases.    ",
            "Of the 14 US cases, two of them were the result of person-to-person transmission, one coming in California and the other in Illinois, health officials said. ",

            "The three patients repatriated from China came from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the CDC.",
            "The two person-to-person transmissions are concerning, as is the fact the virus has caused deaths -- two of the three criteria necessary for declaring a pandemic, she said. ",
            "\"As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus,\" she warned. \"As more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder.\"",
            "Late last week, CDC officials said there were more Diamond Princess passengers who tested positive for coronavirus in Japan and those cases would be added to the US count once the results were official. ",
            "Symptoms similar to a cold",

            "The emergence of hundreds of cases outside China -- namely, in Italy and South Korea -- has served to disrupt global supply chains, corporate profits and American and international markets.",
            "The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.",
            "For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness such as pneumonia or bronchitis. ",
            "There are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly.",
            "There is no specific treatment, but research is underway. Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. People with symptoms that feel worse than a standard cold should see their doctor. ",
            "Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough. ",
            "Drink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible.",
            "People may be able to reduce their risk of infection by avoiding those who are sick, avoiding touching their eyes, nose and mouth, and washing hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds.",

            "\"SARS forced the whole country to pay attention to the livelihood of the people,\" he said, before adding a warning. \"We've made huge progress, but our footsteps are slow, especially in terms of healthcare.\" ",
            "With the Wuhan coronavirus spreading across the country, killing at least 25 people so far, China is now facing a major test of just how much it has changed since 2003, both in terms of the healthcare system's ability to react to a new deadly pathogen -- and crucially, how the central government handles the developing crisis. ",
            "Speaking this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered \"all-out efforts\" to contain the virus' spread and treat those affected. His intervention seemed to carry with it a clear message: the mistakes of SARS will not be repeated. ",
            "Wuhan is only the latest crisis to face Xi since he secured personal control of the Communist Party, joining the US-China trade war, ongoing anti-government unrest in Hong Kong, and the recent Taiwan election, in which Tsai Ing-wen, much loathed by Beijing, handily won reelection against a more pro-China candidate. ",
            "More than any leader since Mao Zedong, Xi has centralized power around himself. He is the state, and while this gives him immense control, it also means that every crisis is a test of his leadership -- Wuhan perhaps most of all, as the country looks to their leader for reassurance and confidence. ",
            "Since Xi's statement, efforts to control the virus have ramped up nationwide, with health authorities ordering the highest level response, typically used to tackle outbreaks of plague or cholera. On Thursday, Wuhan itself -- all 11 million people -- was partially quarantined, with public transport \"temporarily suspended,\" including all planes and trains departing the city.",
            "In state media, editorials urged greater transparency and lauded the central government's quick response and that of Chinese scientists and doctors, who quickly released the virus' genome in order to aid the work of other researchers worldwide in coming up with a vaccine. ",
            "Despite the laudatory efforts of Chinese healthcare workers, however, and forceful statements from Beijing, allegations of an initial -- and potentially even ongoing -- cover-up continue to hang over the Wuhan outbreak. ",
            "This virus could have been China's chance to exorcise the ghosts of SARS once and for all, instead it may have exposed that, for all the progress in the past 17 years, fundamental flaws remain in place when it comes to handling a crisis like this -- ones that could result in far greater danger in future. ",
            "Crisis and cover-up ",
            "The first cases of what would later be called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were identified in southern China in November 2002. The virus would go on to infect more than 8,000 people worldwide, the majority of them in China. ",
            "Even as the deadly pathogen spread throughout Guangdong province, however, media reports were censored and patients and their families prevented from speaking out. If they addressed the issue at all, officials downplayed it, unwilling to risk upsetting the economy or \"social stability\" -- important metrics for future promotion. ",
            "It was not until whisteblower Jiang Yanyong, a retired Chinese army doctor, came forward in early 2003 that much of China and the rest of the world became aware of the true danger -- by which time SARS had already spread widely. The virus was soon declared a \"global threat\" by the World Health Organization (WHO) and efforts to contain its spread were put in place worldwide. ",
            "In the months that followed, China's government officially apologized for its slow reporting of the outbreak, and the country's health minister was sacked, along with the mayor of Beijing at the time. \"Never again\" was the message of the day, one that has been repeated ad nauseum regarding the Wuhan virus. ",
            "While the Communist Party's grasp on power in China has grown stronger than ever under Xi, it's popular legitimacy is much more fragile. The SARS scandal, and similarly mishandled crises such as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, had a devastating effect on that legitimacy, greatly alarming officials who place \"stability\" above all else. ",
            "Xi's gathering of power around himself also means the Wuhan crisis will be more of a test of his personal control of the Party and country -- and of the highly-centralized system he's put in place in recent years. ",
            "Initial problems ",
            "By a number of measures, China's handling of the current crisis has been infinitely better than during SARS. Authorities in Wuhan alerted the public to the new virus in mid-December, soon after the first cases were identified. Xi's statement four weeks later drastically boosted the response and publicized the risk. ",
            "In 2003, by comparison, it was over two months after the first patients were diagnosed with SARS that the WHO was alerted -- by a whistleblower, not the Chinese authorities -- of a \"strange contagious disease\" that has \"already left more than 100 people dead.\"",
            "But behind this outwardly competent handling of a crisis there are signs of a deeper problem. ",
            "One of the oldest cliches in Chinese politics is that \"the mountains are high and the emperor is far away.\" Despite being an intensely centralized state, provincial authorities do not always act as Beijing would prefer, nor do commandments from on high -- to crack down on corruption or reign in pollution, or to increase transparency -- always trickle down to the provinces.",
            "While unconfirmed, there are numerous indications that officials in Wuhan downplayed the risks of the virus for several weeks, delaying proper action and potentially increasing its spread.",
            "Though the first case was detected on December 8 -- it was not until January 14 that officials in Wuhan introduced any screening measures. In the intervening period, a major meeting of the Hubei provincial party was held in the city, and more than 40,000 families were invited to attend a banquet in an attempt to set a world record. ",
            "Speaking to state media, Wuhan officials downplayed the danger, saying the virus was unlikely to be spread from human to human. State officials initially repeated this assessment: Wang Guangfa, head of a team of researchers sent from Beijing to investigate the situation, said on January 11 that it was under control -- he has since been diagnosed with the virus. ",
            "At the same time, Wuhan authorities also tried to clamp down on discussion of the virus. State media reported that police arrested eight people in early January for spreading \"rumors\" that the virus was related to SARS, something which has since been confirmed by health authorities. ",
            "Even as researchers in the UK estimated that the initial spread of the virus could have affected at least 1,700 people, no new cases were reported in Wuhan itself, despite patients being identified in other countries. \"Does the virus only affect overseas travelers?\" people asked darkly on Chinese social media, where accusations of a cover-up quickly spread and were censored. ",
            "It was not until inspectors sent from Beijing had assessed the situation that the alarm was properly raised. In an interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Zhong Nanshan, the SARS hero, said there was \"definitely human-to-human transmission,\" and warned the infection rate was \"climbing.\" ",
            "Worst possible timing",
            "Speaking to state media this week, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted that the city's \"warnings were not sufficient.\" ",
            "Whether because of bureaucratic incompetence or a politically-motivated cover-up, the delay could not have come at a worse time. China is currently in the middle of the Lunar New Year travel rush, in which hundreds of millions of people move across the country, packed close together on trains, coaches and planes. ",
            "Revelations about the true spread and severity of the virus only came after the four-week travel period had got underway, and restrictions on people leaving Wuhan itself did not come into place until Thursday. One woman identified as having the virus in South Korea even told health officials there that she visited a doctor in Wuhan with symptoms -- after screening measures were introduced -- but got sent on her way and was able to leave the country.",
            "The pervasive censorship of the Chinese press and internet undoubtedly played a role in this, as did Xi's years-long crackdown on civil society groups, forcing people to rely on official accounts and the transparency of officials whose own motivations are often completely apposite. ",
            "Once Xi intervened, essentially signaling that the Wuhan virus was fair game for Chinese media, reporters rushed to the scene. Both Caixin and the Beijing News -- some of the most independently minded outlets in the country -- quickly began producing in-depth coverage, some of which exposed oversights by local officials and punched holes in their narrative. Writing on WeChat from Wuhan, Caixin reporter Gao Yu compared the situation to SARS, saying that \"the lack of transparency, public supervision and truth (have) caused huge damage to public safety.\"",
            "China learned hard lessons in 2003 at a terrible cost. The legacy of SARS could be seen in the central government's response this month, and that of Chinese scientists, both of which deserve a great deal of credit. ",
            "But Xi has also reversed gradual liberalization and opening up which occurred post-SARS, massively centralizing power within the Communist Party once again. At the same time, he has overseen a crackdown on the internet, the press and civil society, and an anti-corruption purge that, while it has turfed out plenty of bad apples, may also have left provincial officials more afraid of angering Beijing. ",
            "Xi is the closest China has had to an emperor since Mao, but like the old saying goes, he's often far away. The Wuhan virus shows what happens when the country has to rely on information filtering up to the top for decisive action to be taken. ",

The SARS virus, for example, broke out in China in 2003 and killed 774 people, but it was largely contained and the S&P 500 rose by more than 20% that year.",
            "But things are looking to be much different with the coronavirus. The global economy remains fragile and an extended outbreak could tip the current aging business cycle into a global recession, right when US markets are seeing some of their highest valuations in history. ",

            "Now it's different. Last summer, the US economy officially entered its longest growth expansion in history and many fear that an economy this late in its growth cycle can't handle a larger outside shock. Recessions typically occur on a regular basis and are useful to refresh growth and weed out inefficiencies and excess in the market. But constant central bank intervention has bolstered our economic growth and allowed for excesses and inefficiencies to keep building up in the economy.",
            "Already we had a yield curve scare last summer, and we have seen three rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and a Treasury bills buying program that have been credited with easing recession fears.",
            "In recent weeks, despite record highs in the markets and hopes for a rebound in economic growth in 2020, the bond market has not confirmed the reflation trade. The yield curve has once again flattened and is at risk of inverting again, repeating a pattern last seen just before the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession.",
            "The stock market was already overvalued",
            "The recent market rally has produced some of the largest market valuations in history. US markets have (until last week) been trading at a total market valuation of 157% compared to gross domestic product, or GDP \u2014 a record figure, higher than numbers seen during the 2000 market bubble. ",
            "There is no history that suggests that such high market valuations, that are so disconnected from the underlying size of the economy, are sustainable. In 2000, when market capitalization to GDP reached nearly 150%, the subsequent recession resulted in a valuation reversion to 75% market cap to GDP. In 2007, the market cap to GDP peak reached 110% before reverting to 57% during the following recession. Historically speaking, this is an extremely overvalued market. ",

            "Hong Kong (CNN)On a French newspaper's front page last weekend, big block letters announced \"Yellow Alert\" next to an image of a Chinese woman wearing a face mask. Another headline in the same paper read \"New Yellow Peril?\" above an article about the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.",
            "The headlines drew immediate outrage. Readers accused the paper of using ignorant and offensive language. ",
            "\"Yellow Peril\" was an old racist ideology that targeted East Asians in Western countries. The phrase embodies the worst of anti-Asian fears and stereotypes, which have plagued immigrant communities since the first waves of Chinese immigration to the United States began in the 19th century.  ",
            "In the US, government propaganda and pop culture at the time spread wildly racist and inaccurate images of Chinese people as unclean, uncivilized, immoral, and a threat to society.",
            "To invoke the term now, in a story about death and illness in Asia, seems thoughtless at best and blatantly racist at worst.",
            "The newspaper apologized quickly and said they had no intention of perpetuating \"racist stereotypes of Asians.\" But the damage is not so easily undone, and the paper is not the sole culprit -- merely the latest in a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment as the coronavirus spreads worldwide. ",
            "The escalating global health crisis has claimed more than 200 lives -- all in China -- and infected close to 10,000 people worldwide. As they seek to contain the virus, authorities in multiple countries are balancing the need for warnings against the risk of creating global panic.",
            "However, there are signs that's already happening, with face masks selling out in stores and people locking themselves at home. Some people in central China -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- are desperately taking any flight out, regardless of destination, as governments worldwide suspend flights from China and impose restrictions on travelers from the mainland.",
            "But the panic has also taken another, more familiar form, with the re-emergence of old racist tropes that portray Asians, their food, and their customs as unsafe and unwelcome.",
            "As panic spreads, so does racism",
            "As news of the virus has spread, many people of Asian descent living abroad say they have been treated like walking pathogens. ",
            "Writing for the UK's Guardian newspaper, one British-Chinese journalist in London said a man quickly moved seats when he sat down on a bus.",
            "A Malaysian-Chinese social worker experienced the same thing on a London bus this week. \"A couple of people at an East London school I work in have asked me why Chinese people eat weird food when they know it causes viruses,\" she told CNN.",
            "In Canada, there have been reports of Chinese children being bullied or singled out at school. In New Zealand -- where there are no confirmed coronavirus cases -- a Singaporean woman says she was confronted and faced racist harassment in a mall.",
            "These instances echo a long history of racism in the West. During the Yellow Peril era, anti-Chinese fears led to lynchings of Chinese immigrants, racial violence, systemic discrimination -- even an outright ban on Chinese immigrants for 61 years in the US under the country's Exclusion Act.",
            "That's why the term \"Yellow Peril,\" which contains centuries of trauma, is so charged -- and why the use of it in a contemporary headline was so stunning.",
            "However, this time around anti-Chinese racism is spreading beyond the West. In Vietnam, signs have been seen outside restaurants declaring \"No Chinese.\" The tourist who took the photo told CNN the sign appeared in the past week. Similar signs were also posted outside a Japanese shop, turning away Chinese customers.",
            "And people online from various different places are making racially driven jokes; when TV host James Corden posted a photo with Korean-pop band BTS, one person tweeted, \"BREAKING: James Corden dies of the coronavirus.\" The joke racked up nearly 25,000 likes on Twitter.",
            "Targeting Chinese food",
            "Perhaps the most widespread form of xenophobia comes in fearmongering, sensationalist stereotypes about Chinese food.",
            "The novel coronavirus is believed to have started in a Wuhan seafood and wildlife market, and scientists have pointed to bats and snakes as possible virus carriers. And while the wildlife trade poses legitimate problems, the outbreak has prompted a racially tinged wave of disgust toward Chinese food, and anger from many who accuse Chinese people of recklessly causing a potential global pandemic.",
            "\"Because of some folks in China who eat weird (foods) like bats, rats, and snakes, the entire world is about to suffer a plague,\" said one popular tweet.",
            "This idea has been reinforced by recent media coverage of the coronavirus, some of which has featured misleading videos or photos. One widely shared video, of a Chinese travel blogger eating bat soup, was filmed three years ago in the Pacific island nation of Palau, and the dish has been sampled by Western TV hosts in the past. ",
            "The video and the blogger have no connection to Wuhan or the current outbreak -- but the video has gone viral nonetheless, with many Western viewers expressing horror on social media. There was such an uproar that the blogger came forward to apologize last week.",
            "What viral misinformation and breathless media coverage often miss is that only a small minority of people in China actually eat wild animals. Most people eat much of the same things you would see in other cuisines, like pork or chicken. Ultimately, what people like to eat is culturally relative -- a lot of the Western disgust toward \"weird\" Chinese food is itself Eurocentric.",
            "That's not to say all criticism of Chinese food is invalid; the country does have a problem with badly-regulated trade of wild animals, which has led to previous outbreaks.",
            "The deadly 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was traced to the civet cat, considered a delicacy in southern China. And though the government has introduced some measures limiting wildlife trade, it has been reluctant to take more aggressive action, and illegal trade continues.",
            "It's also difficult to end these practices because of the cultural significance and prevalence of traditional Chinese medicine. Many of these wild animals are thought to hold important medicinal properties -- for instance, people drink snake soup for arthritis and snake bile for a sore throat. ",
            "There is undoubtedly a larger issue that needs to be addressed -- how the government can balance tradition with safer regulations. ",
            "But the beliefs and customs that drive consumption of these foods are centuries old and interwoven in peoples' lives -- they are not so easy to undo, even less so when they are dismissed as primitive and unclean by foreign countries.",
            "'Standing with our Chinese community' ",
            "Right now, we are only seeing early signs of a xenophobic backlash against the East Asian diaspora -- tasteless jokes online, bad headlines, people acting fearfully in public. But if the 2003 SARS epidemic is any model to go by, these strands of xenophobia could potentially escalate into more dangerous, explicit forms of racism.",
            "At the peak of the 2003 outbreak, people of Asian descent were treated like pariahs in the West. There were reports of white people covering their faces in the presence of Asian coworkers, and real estate agents who were told not to serve Asian clients. ",
            "Asian people suffered threats of eviction, had job offers rescinded with no explanation, and some Asian Canadian organizations received outright hate messages. Chinese and Asian businesses suffered heavy losses; in Boston, an April Fool's hoax falsely warned of infected employees at a Chinese restaurant, reportedly causing a 70% drop in the restaurant's business.",
            "This all happened 17 years ago, when China was still slowly opening up. Now it's an emerging superpower, and its role in a range of recent conflicts -- the ongoing US-China trade war, security concerns surrounding telecommunications company Huawei, allegations of Chinese spies in America and Australia -- mean that many in the West already view China with greater suspicion and tension than they did before.",
            "Add the threat of a global pandemic, and a wave of heightened discrimination could be even uglier this time around.",
            "Diaspora communities and local authorities are preparing for this, with many trying to calm fear before it becomes hysteria. In France, the newspaper controversy sparked a social media campaign, with many French Chinese citizens using the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus -- I am not a virus.",
            "In a statement confirming the first case of coronavirus in Los Angeles this week, the local health department stressed that \"people should not be excluded from activities based on their race, country of origin, or recent travel if they do not have symptoms of respiratory illness.\"",
            "The head of Toronto Public Health also warned that misinformation about the virus had created \"unnecessary stigma against members of our community.\" ",
            "\"I am deeply concerned and find it disappointing that this is happening,\" said the head, Eileen de Villa, in a statement Wednesday. \"Discrimination is not acceptable. It is not helpful and spreading misinformation does not offer anyone protection.\"",
            "Toronto Mayor John Tory also spoke out this week about the coronavirus panic. \"Standing with our Chinese community against stigmatization and discrimination,\" he said. \"We must not allow fear to triumph over our values as a city.\"",

            "The decision came after cases of human-to-human transmissions were confirmed outside China, where the outbreak started. A first such case was confirmed in the United States on Thursday, following a case in Germany earlier this week. ",
            "The number of cases of the virus, which has killed at least 213 people, shot up to more than 8,100 in mainland China alone by Thursday evening. That is a higher number of infected people than the number who caught SARS worldwide during the 2002-2003 epidemic. However, the current case fatality rate for Wuhan virus is around 2% -- significantly smaller than SARS' 9.6% mortality rate. ",
            "While the virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, there are now more than 100 cases in 20 other countries and territories spanning Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East. India and the Philippines were the latest to confirm the virus had reached their shores. ",
            "Thousands of people were held on a cruise ship in Italy on Thursday and Russia closed off its borders with China as global fears continued to grow over the rapidly spreading Wuhan coronavirus. ",
            "On Thursday, 7,000 people, including 1,000 crew, were confined to a cruise ship in a port near Rome as a couple was being tested for the virus. A spokesperson for Costa Cruises told CNN that a 54-year-old woman aboard the cruise ship was suffering from a fever and that she and her husband were both being tested. Italian news agency ANSA and public broadcaster RAI reported that the woman and her husband were from Hong Kong and were being kept separately in solitary confinement in the hospital section of the cruiseliner.",
            "The Costa Smeralda cruise ship is now docked at Civitavecchia port, a coastal town northwest of Rome. It had arrived from Palma de Majorca, Spain, as part of its tour of the western Mediterranean.",

            "In the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where only 10 cases have been confirmed, the government has closed a high-speed rail station that would usually connect the city to China's mainland. Hong Kong has introduced new limits it says will cut the amount of mainland Chinese travelers coming to the city by 80%.",
            "A CNN correspondent described Hong Kong as a ghost town, with empty shops and streets at a time that Chinese New Year celebrations usually light up the city. Instead, people lined up for more than three hours to collect surgical face masks to help keep them safe from the virus.",

            "Some 60 million people across Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital, are on some level of lockdown, and many travelers from the region have been ordered to self-quarantine, holed up in their apartments or hotel rooms for days on end. ",
            "In Wuhan itself, 11 million people are marking a week on lockdown with no sign of immediate relief. Nor is there firm evidence that their sacrifice has been worth it, with the virus spreading around the country and scientists warning that other major cities could soon become self-sustaining epidemics.",
            "Online, people trapped in their houses have been uploading videos and photos showing various ways they are staying busy -- staging makeshift Lunar New Year lion dances in their apartments, exercising, and urging others to keep their spirits up. But as the lockdown stretches on, such positivity may be harder to come by, particularly as some begin to feel the lost wages or business.",

            "Tokyo (CNN)Japanese authorities are racing to contain a possible outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus after it was revealed that an infected passenger flew into Tokyo and spent a few days aboard a Princess Cruises ship, forcing authorities to lock down the vessel and quarantine thousands of people on board. ",
            "The ship, the Diamond Princess, ended its planned 14-day itinerary early and is currently docked off the coast of Yokohama, not far from the Japanese capital. Medical officials are going room-by-room to check each guests' temperature and medical condition, Japan's health ministry said in a statement. Several passengers have reported feeling ill, and the tests to check if they contracted the virus will take four to five hours, the ministry said. ",
            "Of the 31 people who have been tested for the virus, 10 cases tested positive for the virus, Japan's Health Ministry said. Authorities are still waiting for the results of more than 100 other samples. ",
            "Passengers and crew were initially required to stay on board until at least Tuesday night, but it appears they may be there longer. Japanese health officials said more passengers than expected need to be temporarily quarantined while being tested, and it could take another day to finish the screenings.   ",
            "There are\u202f2,666\u202fguests and\u202f1,045\u202fcrew members on board, Princess Cruises said in a statement.",
            "Japan has previously reported 20 cases of the novel coronavirus, all unrelated to the cruise. ",
            "Though Japanese officials have moved quickly to respond to this case, it has renewed concern about just how easy it could be for one patient who is unwittingly carrying the virus to pass it on in an increasingly globalized world where millions of people travel at ease.",
            "Health authorities say patients can be infectious even if they are not presenting symptoms. The incubation period is believed to be about 14 days. However, researchers are still working to determine whether the Wuhan coronavirus can spread via what's known as the fecal-oral route, an important factor in determining just how infectious the virus is, said Dr. John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at the University of Hong Kong.",
            "However, Nicholls cautioned against panic because there are just too many unknowns surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus and this case to determine how widely one individual could spread the virus. ",
            "\"These days, you can fly anywhere, so there's going to be more chance that isolated cases my come up in other countries,\" Nicholls said. \"At this stage there's no evidence of wide spreading in other communities.\"",
            "The man who tested positive for the virus is an 80-year-old from Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese city said in a statement. The infected patient had not been to healthcare facilities or seafood markets, nor had he had exposure to wild animals during his incubation period -- meaning he likely contracted the virus from another human. The man visited mainland China for \"a few hours\" on January 10, the statement said.",
            "The man flew into Tokyo -- the world's most populous city -- on January 17 with his two daughters, and two days later said he began developing a cough, Hong Kong authorities said. He boarded the cruise in Yokohama on January 20, and when it stopped back in Hong Kong on January 25, part of its pre-planned itinerary, he got off and never returned. He sought medical attention on January 30 and was diagnosed with the virus shortly after. He is currently in a stable condition.",
            "Princess Cruises, which is owned by the Miami and London-headquartered Carnival Corporation, said in its statement that the man did not visit the ship's medical center.",
            "It's also unclear how many passengers may have disembarked early. The Japanese health ministry said it is tracing people who may have disembarked in Okinawa, the cruise's second-to-last stop. The ministry is also investigating the infected patient's movements during his time in Japan but must rely on authorities in Hong Kong for information since the patient is there, authorities said.",
            "Cruise lines are more at risk of the spread of any virus because the vessels have so many people living in such close quarters. Eight international cruise liners reported outbreaks of norovirus -- a contagious stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhea -- in 2019, according to the CDC. Norovirus can be transmitted the fecal-oral route.",
            "Some 6,000 passengers on a cruise ship in Italy were quarantined last week after two guests were suspected of having the Wuhan coronavirus. Italy's health ministry said tests revealed the duo had a different flu virus, not the coronavirus that has spread through China. ",
            "Several cruise lines have announced measures aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. Princess Cruises and Carnival Cruises have all enacted controls barring guests from ships if they have traveled from or through mainland China in the 14 days prior to the departure date of the cruise. Royal Caribbean took similar action, but extended the date to 15 days and also included Hong Kong as well as mainland China.",
            "More cases and more travel advisories",
            "The novel coronavirus has infected more than 20,000 people in the two months since it has been identified, and killed 427 people -- 425 people in mainland China, a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong, who died Tuesday. ",
            "The vast majority of the cases have been confirmed in Hubei province. Its capital, Wuhan, is believed to be the epicenter of the outbreak. The city has been essentially locked down and about 60 million people throughout Hubei are under some sort of travel restriction to stop the spread of the virus. ",
            "More than 185 cases have been confirmed in over 25 places worldwide, prompting countries and airlines around the world to place varying levels of travel restrictions on China. ",
            "The most stringent appear to be in the United States, banning all foreign nationals who have entered China in the last 14 days. Washington has faced criticism for its move at home and abroad. Some, like Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, have called the Trump administration's guidelines opaque and confusing. Beijing also slammed the US decision as an overreaction that would feed into mass hysteria about the virus.",
            "\"The US government hasn't provided any substantial assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its Embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers. All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Monday. ",
            "Hua also said the US decision to bar foreigners who had been to China in recent days was likely a violation of their civil rights and was rejected by the World Health Organization (WHO).",
            "The WHO said last week that it was advising countries to enact \"measures to limit the risk of exportation or importation of the disease,\" but without what it called \"unnecessary restrictions of international traffic.\" ",

Even as states ramp up their capabilities -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York on Saturday -- the reality is that we face a testing shortage. That means the current number of cases could be underreported while community spread becomes increasingly likely.",

            "But historically a mass quarantine is an aggressive response that's far from perfect. In the past it has led to political, financial and social consequences. ",
            "The shutdown of Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people where the virus originated, is \"utterly incredible,\" Howard Markel, professor and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, told CNN. ",

            "\"Nothing on this scale has ever been tried,\" he told CNN. \"There's very little evidence of its effectiveness. And I think there's good reason to think that it could backfire, from a public health, social, human rights perspective.\" ",
            "No quarantine goes perfectly",
            "Quarantines date back to Italy in the 1300s, as the bubonic plague ravaged Europe. In Venice, sailors and ships coming from infected ports were made to wait 40 days before docking in a practice called \"quaranta giorni,\" or \"40 days.\" ",
            "People criticize quarantines because in practice a virus or bacteria \"invariably gets loose,\" Markel said, as do people. \"Every quarantine, people get out,\" he said. \"They just do, especially one of this magnitude.\"",
            "Large-scale quarantines like the one in Wuhan are generally avoided nowadays, with the medical community more focused on providing treatment, medication and vaccines to prevent them entirely, according to Markel.",
            "Quarantines \"can stay things or quell things for a while,\" he said, \"but they're not the best things to use long-term.\"",
            "They can also lead to logistical issues. Just the word \"quarantine\" can cause panic or hysteria, Markel said. Anyone concerned about a common cold or sniffle will head for hospitals, straining already precious resources. Wuhan officials have already acknowledged local hospitals were struggling to accommodate people seeking medical attention.",
            "There are also human rights implications when Wuhan and more than a dozen other Chinese cities are placed under lockdown, Gostin said. \"I don't think you can enforce a mass quarantine of 30 million people without violating human rights.\" ",
            "Gostin also questioned the effectiveness of the approach, pointing to smaller quarantines during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. \"It spurred public violence, there was ... distrust of public health authorities, people didn't come in for treatment and it was thought that it actually set back the outbreak response considerably,\" he said. ",
            "There are broader financial and social consequences",
            "But outside the realm of public health, quarantines can present broader societal problems. Perhaps most obvious is the economic impact.",

            "The flow of trade in and out of the quarantined zone is halted, and goods in the process of being shipped could go bad -- depending on how long it lasts. ",

            "These economic impacts are a large part of why quarantines are seen as a \"less desirable course of action,\" White said. ",
            "Then there are the social consequences, White said, particularly for marginalized members of a community. Historically, he said, the aggressive control needed in a quarantine can link the disease to marginalized people and potentially fuel existing anxieties about race and class. ",
            "White pointed to an outbreak of bubonic plague in Cape Town in 1901 that led to a racially segregated quarantine camp, which he said was later used as a blueprint for racial segregation during apartheid.",
            "Markel told CNN there was a \"long history of quarantine being misused as a social separator, rather than a public health one.\" ",
            "\"There's a risk of stigmatization,\" he said, \"that marginalized groups are rightly concerned about and fear.\" ",
            "Trust and cooperation are key",
            "There's still a lot that's unknown about the coronavirus outbreak and how Chinese officials are responding to it. ",
            "But generally, the trust and cooperation of the public is the most important thing for officials to have in a public health crisis, said Gostin. ",
            "Without it, people won't come in for testing and won't share the names of people they've been in contact with -- a vital part of the strategy to prevent the spread of disease. ",
            "\"People get fearful, they hunker down ... You can't go to social clubs, you can't see friends. A lockdown of 30 million people -- that really upends their lives.\" ",
            "Gostin believes the best way to tackle a situation like the one in Wuhan is a \"surge of the public health response,\" he said. It should be easier for people to get to hospital and there should be mobile clinics that meet people at their homes to provide testing and treatment.",
            "Governments implementing a quarantine should still want the public's cooperation, said Markel. The government should provide plenty of explanation and keep up constant communication",

            "This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.",
            "Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease.",
            "Read: What exactly is a coronavirus?",
            "Zoonotic transmission",
            "Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans.",
            "Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans.",
            "In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market.",
            "The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses.",
            "The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. The authors further found that the viral RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the \"crown\" of the virus particle that recognizes the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people.",
            "How influenza jumped from animals to humans",
            "But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes.",
            "The Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where the coronavirus outbreak is believed to have started, is now closed.",
            "From bats to snakes",
            "The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes.",
            "Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species -- bats -- to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.",
            "The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus' source animal.",
            "3 reasons the US is not ready for a pandemic",
            "Sampling viral RNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols.",
            "The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections.",

Neither crew member appears symptomatic and they are both remaining in their cabins out of an abundance of caution, Princess Cruises said in a statement. ",

That advisory says passengers who have traveled to a Level 3 country (China, Iran,  Italy and South Korea) should stay at home for 14 days and limit their interaction with others after coming back.

Follow him on Twitter @WorldAffairsPro. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his; view more opinions on CNN.",
            " (CNN)As the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread around the world, the World Health Organization's decision to hold off on declaring the outbreak \"a public health emergency of international concern\" is baffling.",
            "The virus, which is similar to the fatal severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), first emerged in Wuhan, China, which has a population greater than New York City. More than 1,900 people have already been infected, and more than 55 people have died. To contain the virus during the Lunar New Year, which marks the largest annual human migration in the world, the Chinese government placed a lockdown on 12 cities, affecting about 35 million people. On Saturday, China said it would halt all outbound international tour groups starting Monday. ",
            "Although authorities in Wuhan initially cracked down on people accused of spreading \"rumors\" about the illness, the Chinese government has since taken rapid and strict measures to contain the virus. Their efforts are laudable but may not be sufficient given the movement of people who may have been infected in the weeks before the lockdown was ordered. ",
            "While Chinese officials have a responsibility to limit the spread of the outbreak, global health officials in Geneva need to take quick action. By declaring a global emergency, WHO would set in motion coordination efforts among various countries and encourage UN member states to institute strict surveillance measures. While some initial panic could result, WHO's leadership would jolt passive governments into action.",
            "In making its decision not to declare a global public health emergency, WHO officials cited a limited number of cases abroad, and strong, preventative containment measures in China. \"While this outbreak is an emergency in China, it has not yet become a global health emergency,\" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told me.",
            "However, the number of overseas cases are growing rapidly. There are more than 35 cases in more than a dozen countries and territories outside mainland China, including two in the United States. On Friday, the first European cases were confirmed in France. As for the number of cases in China, some experts suggest the total could be far higher than what is currently being reported. ",
            "By WHO's own definition, an international public health emergency is \"an extraordinary event which is determined ... to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.\" Given what we've seen of the Wuhan coronavirus so far, the threshold for the declaration has surely been met.",
            "In a public statement, the organization said, \"the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should be reconvened in a matter of days to examine the situation further.\"",
            "In a 2018 report analyzing the responses to the earlier Ebola, Zika and H1N1 public health emergencies, public health researchers Steven Hoffman and Sarah Silverberg wrote, \"When the systems for recognizing and responding to disease outbreaks act too slowly, the result is unnecessary delay, greater disease spread, additional people affected, and more lives lost.\"",
            "The WHO, a mainline UN agency which is heavily influenced by members states, has used the international public health emergency declaration sparingly, has come under fire for being too slow to act. We saw that when WHO finally declared Ebola a public health emergency of international concern in 2014, eight months after the outbreak first emerged. By that time, the outbreak had already spread to three countries, and the virus ultimately killed more than 11,000 people. ",
            "\"Ebola exposed WHO as unable to meet its responsibility for responding to such situations and alerting the global community,\" said an independent panel of experts in 2015 that included members from the Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",
            "The panel went further, suggesting the establishment of a new global health committee within the UN Security Council to declare outbreaks and international emergencies for more timely responses.",
            "A perfect storm for authorities in Beijing?",
            "Placing cities on lockdown, especially when tens of millions of Chinese people planned to travel and celebrate the Lunar New Year holidays, has already sparked panic and created a headache for the Chinese Communist Party. Long lines have been reported at local hospitals, tourist attractions like the Forbidden City in Beijing and Shanghai Disneyland have been closed, and large public gatherings are now forbidden around China. Public criticism of authorities has increased dramatically on social media, although many of the posts were later taken down.",
            "What happens next in terms of public reaction may be of a magnitude not seen by Beijing authorities for some time. After all, far more minor events have sparked protests in China \u2014 including protests over a waste incineration plant near Wuhan last year in which riot police had to be deployed. ",
            "Let's be clear. The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading rapidly, including to other continents outside of Asia. There is no known vaccine. Tens of millions of people who live in China or recently traveled to the Hubei province are still on the move. ",
            "In the absence of a declaration of a global public health emergency, governments or regional bodies such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are free to coordinate action themselves. ",
            "Out of an abundance of caution, the UN should act immediately to raise the international alarm to prevent further infections and deaths. So far, cities like Vancouver, which has an international airport hosting numerous Chinese airlines,  haven't instituted thermal screening for incoming passengers. In Toronto, Ontario's chief medical officer of health announced on Saturday the first \"presumptive\" case of the coronavirus in Canada. ",
            "While the declaration of a global public health emergency could stoke widespread fear and would by no means bring the outbreak under control, it will push countries around the world to take preventative action and encourage them to step up surveillance. If there is one thing that we have learned from previous outbreaks, viruses do not respect borders and thrive when there is a lack of urgent and coordinated human action. Time is of the essence.",

The hope is that more people will be able to receive treatment by receiving this diagnosis.",

            "The Snohomish County resident was in stable condition Thursday and remains in isolation, Diaz said. ",
            "Washington state health officials confirmed Thursday that they have reached out to 43 people considered \"close contacts\" of the 30-year-old man, who identified the people he had interacted with since returning from Wuhan, China. Those contacts will be called daily and actively monitored for signs of any illness.",
            "He arrived at the hospital in a special isolated gurney called an ISOPOD and has been treated in a two-bed isolated area away from busy sections of the hospital, the doctor said.",
            "\"The nursing staff in the room move the robot around so we can see the patient in the screen, talk to him,\" Diaz said, adding the use of the robot minimizes exposure of medical staff to the infected man.",
            "It's unclear when the patient will be released because the CDC, which is set to provide the discharge details, has recommended additional testing. ",
            "\"They're looking for ongoing presence of the virus,\" Diaz told CNN on Thursday. \"They're looking to see when the patient is no longer contagious.\" ",
            "About two weeks ago, the hospital tested its protocol for treating patients with highly contagious diseases such as MERS and Ebola. The hospital made changes after the Ebola outbreak.",
            "\"That's why we set up protocols that will allow us to treat patients with infectious diseases in a way that we can isolate them without spreading the virus to anyone,\" Diaz told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
            "Washington state health officials confirmed Thursday they have been reaching out to 43 people considered to be \"close contacts\" of the patient. ",
            "The department defined \"close contacts\" as anyone who interacted with the patient and came within 3 to 6 feet of the infected person, for a prolonged period of time while infectious or had direct contact with his secretions.",
            "The virus has killed at least 25 people in China, seven of whom did not have preexisting conditions before they contracted the illness, and sickened more than 800, as far afield as the US.",
            "The true extent of the Wuhan coronavirus is unclear, however, and official figures may be an underestimation as mild symptoms and delayed onset mean cases are likely to have been undetected, a team of scientists have said.",

Unions said strike action will continue Tuesday unless further action is taken by Lam. ",

The net amount of cash flooding into the market will be closer to 150 billion yuan ($22 billion), according to Reuters, as more than 1 trillion yuan worth of other short-term bond agreements matured Monday.",
            "Hong Kong is also bracing for further difficulties. The city was already in a technical recession after more than six months of anti-government protests and the US-China trade war, and many analysts fear the effects of the virus could wipe out many businesses. ",
            "While the national economy is already suffering, it's unclear how long Chinese workers can remain at home, with many facing several weeks out of work since the beginning of the Lunar New Year holiday.

            "A purpose-built hospital dedicated to treating the virus also opened in Wuhan Monday. The institution was constructed in under a week, and a second is due to open Thursday. Both will only handle coronavirus patients, helping to take the pressure off the severely stretched Wuhan healthcare system. ",
            "Chinese health officials said that the average time needed for a patient to recover is nine days. However, in Hubei province, the average recovery time is currently at 20 days because there are more severe cases. ",

            "\"The situation in China and the measures being taken to protect the population are having a material impact on our business,\" John Idol, the CEO of Capri Holdings, said in a statement Wednesday. ",
            "The coronavirus outbreak has killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,500 more \u2014 mainly in China, where close to 60 million people are living in cities on lockdown.",
            "Retailers are shutting their doors as efforts to contain the virus ramp up and would-be shoppers stay home. ",
            "Roughly 150 of Capri's stores in mainland China are closed, according to the company. Nike said it has shuttered about half of the stores it owns in China, while Adidas said the company and its franchisees had shut a \"significant\" number of shops.",
            "Nike and Capri Holdings said the stores that do remain open are operating with reduced hours and seeing fewer shoppers.",
            "\"In the short term, we expect the situation to have a material impact on our operations in Greater China,\" Nike said in a statement Tuesday, though it noted that its online business has shown \"continued strength.\"",
            "Nearly 18% of Nike's sales came from the greater China region in the most recent quarter. CEO John Donahoe told CNBC Wednesday the company's \"first priority as a company is to unequivocally tend to our partners in China and consumers.\"",
            "Adidas said it was \"too early to assess the magnitude\" of the impact at this point. But Capri Holdings told investors that it expects the coronavirus to reduce revenue by $100 million this quarter, and warned the hit could be bigger if \"the severity of the situation worsens.\"",
            "The companies join a growing list of global brands that have decided to limit operations in China, despite their reliance on the country for growth. Apple (AAPL) has said all 42 of its stores in China will shut until February 9 \"out of an abundance of caution.\" Starbucks (SBUX) said it had closed more than half of its roughly 4,300 Chinese locations last week.",

            " (CNN)In their botched handling of the tragic death of Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who sounded the alarm on the Wuhan coronavirus, authorities in Beijing seem to want it both ways.",
            "On the one hand, officials have expressed their sorrow over his death and encouraged people to tell the truth about the outbreak. On the other hand, government censors are hard at work scrubbing online posts that call for freedom of speech in the wake of Li's death. ",
            "When millions of people are denied the opportunity to grieve collectively over someone widely regarded as a hero, their trust in government can only further erode. As Li recently told the Chinese magazine Caixin before his death: \"I think a healthy society should not only have one kind of voice.\" ",
            "Li is credited with being the first medical professional to sound the alarm on the Wuhan coronavirus weeks before he contracted the illness himself and died. In late December, he messaged his medical school alumni group on WeChat, informing them that seven people from a local seafood market who showed signs of a SARS-like illness were quarantined in his hospital in Wuhan. When screenshots of his post went viral with his name in plain view, Li said, \"I realized it was out of my control and I would probably be punished.\" ",
            "As he told CNN, \"I only wanted to remind my university classmates to be careful.\"",
            "Li was later called to a police station, reprimanded for spreading rumors online, and forced to sign a statement acknowledging his \"misdemeanor\" before he was allowed to leave. Weeks later, China's Supreme Court vindicated him and other \"rumormongers\" by saying, \"It might have been a fortunate thing ... if the public had listened to this 'rumor' at the time...\"",
            "Not just a statistic",
            "On Friday, Li became one of more than 700 casualties of the Wuhan coronavirus. But he is much more than a statistic.",
            "While Li may not be immortalized to the same degree as the lone protester who faced off against a column of tanks in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 anti-government protests, his \"normal guy\"  persona, and sense of duty has transformed him into an overnight hero -- and his death has unleashed an unprecedented tsunami of grief and anger that probably has not been seen since President Xi Jinping rose to power.",
            "Beijing seemed caught off-guard by the response to Li's death, and the Chinese government initially directed state-controlled news outlets to say that he was still on life support and in critical condition, according to the BBC. These news outlets later acknowledged Li's passing, but his time of death was changed from the evening of February 6, to the early hours of February 7, the BBC reported.",
            "This was a rare show of confusion from the Chinese government, as well as a stark reminder of the extent to which it is willing to exert control over the narrative.",
            "And to many Chinese people, it was a tipping point, given that manipulation and suppression of information is what allowed the wide spread of the novel coronavirus in the first place.  Anger expressed on online forums is intense, with even prominent officials, academics and executives expressing grief and outrage. In online posts and in open letters, demands range from an official apology and admission that the government had made a mistake, to a state funeral for Li and even a US-style whistleblower protection law. ",
            "In an apparent effort to appease the masses and quell the backlash, central authorities announced they are dispatching a team from the country's top anti-corruption agency to Wuhan to look into \"issues related to Dr. Li Wenliang.\"",
            "The crisis in handling the outbreak, coupled with the botched rollout of the news of Li's death, is \"as close the an existential crisis for (Chinese President) Xi and the (Communist) Party that I think we have seen since 1989,\" wrote Bill Bishop in his Sinocism newsletter.",
            "Beijing's strategy  ",
            "It's unclear what Beijing's strategy is at this point. While the Chinese government has taken swift action to try to curtail the coronavirus' spread since news of the outbreak blew up, we don't yet know whether the containment measures are working to stabilize the situation and bringing a quick return to normality.",
            "With some 50 million people in China still under lockdown, along with medical supply shortages and growing discontent over restrictions on movement and free speech, there is still plenty of scope for things to boil over. The Chinese economy has grown substantially in the last two decades, and the economic impact of the novel coronavirus could cause a slowdown that far outweighs the one caused by the SARS outbreak in 2003. ",
            "It is important to remember that China's model of governance has always been one based on paternalism, and the authoritarian hold Xi and the Communist Party have on its people relies heavily on economic growth.",
            "But that model is now under threat -- and the coronavirus has revealed deep structural flaws and incompetence in the government. Such revelations undermine the tenuous trust that Xi must maintain with the Chinese people, lest the system crumble. While lower level officials will almost certainly take the fall, the Communist Party will put on a united front and Xi -- who has been in and out of public view the past few weeks -- will make every effort to maintain his power.",
            "If Beijing follows its usual playbook, it will feign an investigation into what happened to Li -- perhaps continuing to express remorse for the way he was treated -- and then work hard to gloss over the incident and hope that his death fades from collective memory. ",
            "Meanwhile, though the government is now outwardly acknowledging Li's death, officials appear to be employing a sledgehammer approach to online displays of discontent, deleting posts and even closing down WeChat accounts -- which one of my mainland business contacts likened to a digital death sentence in China.",
            "In another worrying sign, a lawyer-turned-citizen journalist who had been posting critical videos of the outbreak response from Wuhan, has been forcibly quarantined, according to his friends and family.",
            "What will come of Li's main legacies, which include calls for more freedom of speech and accountability on the mainland? The brutality unleashed on anti-government protesters in Hong Kong in the past few months is a pretty good indicator of how unlikely it will be for the Chinese government to loosen control over its people.",

Some cities have also been effectively quarantined. That means major trouble for the world's second biggest economy. ",
            "The virus outbreak escalated just before the new year, one of China's most significant economic events. Chinese consumers spent more than 1 trillion yuan ($145 billion) last year on holiday shopping, dining, entertainment and travel, according to state news agency Xinhua. ",
            "Extensive travel restrictions and fears about the virus mean people aren't spending as much this week. But the extended holiday \u2014 to February 2 nationwide and for another week beyond that in Shanghai and several provinces \u2014 will impact millions of people in other ways as government offices and schools remain closed.",
            "Major companies such as Tencent (TCEHY), Huawei and Alibaba (BABA), will feel the effects, too, as head offices remain shut. Tencent (TENC) has told its roughly 54,000 employees that it will be extending holidays until February 9.",
            "Exactly how big the economic hit will be is hard to predict. China hasn't come to a complete standstill \u2014 the Shanghai Stock Exchange is reopening on February 3. Grocery stores and food delivery services are still up and running, even in areas under lockdown.",
            "ING economist Iris Pang said Wednesday that the outbreak would knock a modest 0.3 percentage points off China's first quarter growth. ",
            "But Tommy Wu, analyst at Oxford Economics, said the impact could be worse than the SARS outbreak in 2003, given the coronavirus is spreading rapidly and coincides with the holiday travel rush. Economists at Nomura warned that the outbreak could knock more than two percentage points off growth in the first quarter \u2014 larger than the quarterly drop registered during SARS. ",

            "Before the outbreak escalated this month, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had forecast China's annual economic growth to fall to about 6%, down from 6.1% in 2019.",
            "Perret-Green said the outbreak and measures to contain it could push China's 2020 GDP growth rate near levels last seen in 1990, when it was 3.9%, according to World Bank data.",
            "\"Officially it may be closer to 4.5% and possibly the reality could be close to zero,\" said Perret-Green, who suggested the government severely overstates its GDP figures to begin with.",
            "Margaret Yang, an analyst at brokerage firm CMC Markets, said the \"adverse economic impact is enormous.\" ",
            "All sectors will likely feel the effects of the delay in getting back to work, she said in a research note Tuesday, singling out transportation, tourism, entertainment, retail and commercial property. ",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus has already killed 132 people, and infected over 6,000 others in China, but is not yet as lethal as the 2003 SARS outbreak. SARS had a roughly 10% fatality rate, compared to the estimated 3% for the coronavirus right now.",
            "But the economic costs aren't only about how deadly the virus is, according to Andrew Batson and Ernan Cui, analysts at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. ",
            "\"These costs are instead going to be determined by the measures China's government takes to contain its spread \u2014 measures which have rapidly escalated to an unprecedented severity,\" they wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ",
            "Travel and tourism will have an outsized effect, Batson and Cui said. They noted that the sector raked in 514 billion yuan ($74 billion) during the seven-day holiday in 2019, equivalent to 2% of first quarter GDP. ",
            "Travel industry suffering",
            "There has already been a plunge in the number of trips made during the holiday. Liu Xiaoming, China's vice minister for transport, told reporters on Sunday that the overall number of trips made across the country on the first day of the Lunar New Year fell nearly 30% from a year ago. Travel by plane and train fell more than 41%, he added.",
            "Major travel companies, hotels and airlines are waiving cancellation fees and offering refunds through most of February. Some airlines are suspending services. ",
            "Meanwhile, major tourist spots including museums, Beijing's Forbidden City and even Disney's (DIS) parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have shuttered their doors. Beijing and other cities across China also canceled Lunar New Year celebrations, trying to limit crowds. ",
            "\"This will mean a permanent loss of revenue from tourist activities, as the canceled excursions are not going to be repeated after the holiday is over,\" wrote Batson and Cui. ",

Residents set up roadblocks and clashed with police, and on Sunday the authorities said they were abandoning the plan. ",
            "Memories of the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak run deep in Hong Kong, and paranoia is already starting to settle in, with a rush purchases of face masks leading to shortages which may not be relieved until February, due to the Lunar New Year holiday and demand from China. ",

            "Authorities in China's Wuhan city have confirmed 45 cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus, which is in the same family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but so far appears to be less lethal. Two people have died, Wuhan authorities say.",

This implies there might have been over 1,700 cases in Wuhan so far,\" Ferguson told CNN.",
            "\"There are many unknowns, meaning the uncertainty range around this estimate goes from 190 cases to over 4,000.

Kennedy International Airport in New York, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport.

            "Then came a sudden jump in infections. Until January 17, the Wuhan authorities had only reported 41 cases of the virus. By January 20, that number had soared to 198.",

            "Later that evening, Zhong Nanshan, a government-appointed respiratory expert, known for fighting SARS 17 years ago, declared on state broadcaster CCTV that the new coronavirus was transmissible from person to person.  ",
            "Three days later, authorities placed an unprecedented lockdown on Wuhan, the economic engine and transportation hub of China's central heartland -- but five million people had already left the city for the Lunar New Year holiday.",

            "In an interview with CCTV on January 27, Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted his government did not disclose information on the coronavirus \"in a timely fashion.\"",

            "By late January, the Wuhan government's mishandling of the outbreak was becoming well-understood in China. Many online thought of the group of eight \"rumormongers,\" saying their early warnings could have saved hundreds of lives. ",
            "Calls for the eight to be vindicated grew -- even in state media. Xi's call for the timely release of information was seen as a green light to report on the coronavirus and Chinese journalists began producing in-depth coverage and hard-hitting investigative reports. The state-run newspaper Beijing Youth Daily interviewed Li and the article went viral. The piece was censored within hours, but the uproar remained.",
            "As public anger mounted, China's Supreme Court on January 28 criticized the Wuhan police for punishing the \"rumormongers.\" ",
            "\"It might have been a fortunate thing for containing the new coronavirus, if the public had listened to this 'rumor' at the time, and adopted measures such as wearing masks, strict disinfection and avoiding going to the wildlife market,\" the Supreme Court commentary said.",
            "Bowing to pressure, the Wuhan police issued a statement the next day, saying the eight people had only committed \"particularly minor\" misdemeanors for spreading \"unverified information.\" It said they had only been summoned for a talk and not detained or fined.",
            "On Saturday, another \"rumormonger\" came forward with her story in the Chinese press. ",
            "Xie Linka, an oncologist at Wuhan Union Hospital, told Chinese media she received a warning from police after sending an alert to her colleagues in a WeChat group on the evening of December 30. ",
            "In the message, Xie relayed a warning from fellow doctors about an infectious disease: \"Don't go to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the near future. Several people were found to have contracted an unknown pneumonia similar to SARS there. Today our hospital has received multiple patients from the market. Everyone please remember to wear masks and ventilate properly.\"",
            "Now recovering in a quarantine ward, Li said he was not sure if he was one of the eight \"rumormongers.\" But he felt relieved after reading the Supreme Court commentary, taking it as a sign that the central government is against giving him a harsh punishment.  ",
            "On Li's Weibo, tens of thousands have left comments thanking him for speaking out and wishing him a speedy discovery.",
            "\"Dr Li, you're a good doctor with conscience. I hope you stay safe and sound,\" read one of the top-rated comments.",
            "Others have questioned what could have been if Li's warning had been heeded.",

Although many analysts think it's too early to tell just how hard Apple might be hit by the disease, any major or extended disruption could hammer its production and sales in one blow.",
            "Apple had been looking forward to a turnaround in China. Last year, slumping demand hit sales numbers, and trade tensions caused uncertainty for its supply chain. But in the three months ending in December, sales in the region returned to growth, thanks in large part to the popularity of the iPhone 11.",

Chinese officials had already extended the Lunar New Year holiday from January 30 to February 2, forcing companies to keep their doors closed longer in hopes of stemming the spread of the virus. ",
            "Some retailers, including Starbucks and Pizza Hut, announced that they plan to suspend store operations even beyond the end of the holiday, and some airlines are offering refunds to people who cancel their travels. ",
            "CEO Tim Cook said on a call with Wall Street analysts Tuesday that Apple has closed one retail store and shortened hours at some of the others that remain open. He added that the company is regularly deep cleaning stores that remain open, and is conducting temperature checks on employees to avoid the spread of the virus. ",
            "\"We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,\" Cook said. \"The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.\" ",
            "Cook said that while the sales at the Wuhan area store are relatively small, store closures at other Apple retailers and a general decline in retail traffic across the country could negatively impact sales. Sales in China make up about 15% of Apple's total revenue. ",
            "But unlike some other retailers, Apple has more to worry about than just its consumer sales. The company's manufacturing \u2014 particularly the production of the iPhone \u2014 is centered in China. ",
            "Apple has some suppliers in Wuhan, which is known as a manufacturing hub, and Cook said Chinese officials have delayed the opening of factories in that area from the end of January to February 10. ",
            "The company aimed to factor the risk of lost production at those facilities into its guidance for the current quarter, and has developed a mitigation plan based on alternate sources, Cook said Tuesday. However, he said the impact of the disease on production facilities in other areas of the country is \"less clear at this time.\"",
            "Foxconn, one of Apple's main manufacturing partners in the region, especially for the iPhone, said in a statement Wednesday that it is following \"holiday schedules,\" indicating it does not plan to keep factories closed beyond what is currently required by Chinese officials. ",
            "\"As a matter of policy and for reasons of commercial sensitivity, we do not comment on our specific production practices but we can confirm that we have measures in place to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations,\" the company said. It added that having previously handled the SARS out break in the early 2000s, the company understands how to mitigate the effects of such an outbreak. ",
            "That's likely a good sign for Apple, at least for now, Synovus' Morgan said.",
            "\"With the SARS events a few years ago, everyone got all upset but it didn't really do too much,\" Morgan said. \"They have a whole chip and hardware ecosystem (in the region), so if you start to see that having problems, that will be an indication that Apple could have an issue.

            "The patient has been under the 14-day federal quarantine since arriving in the United States from China on a chartered flight on February 7, the CDC said. The person, described by a CDC official as a \"solo traveler,\" has been isolated and is receiving medical care at a hospital. ",
            "\"We are right in the middle of that potential incubation period so it is not surprising that maybe someone would have developed symptoms in this time frame,\" Capt. Jennifer McQuiston of the CDC said in a news conference Thursday. \"And we're going to continue to be watching people during the whole 14-day quarantine period.\" ",
            "Officials are investigating the patient's movements while in quarantine and monitoring any individuals who had contact with the patient, McQuiston said. ",
            "\"For the most part the people in quarantine are not doing much associating with each other,\" she said. ",
            "The patient is receiving treatment at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, according to Dr. Paul Hancock, chief medical officer at Methodist Healthcare System. ",
            "The patient had a fever but is currently \"stable with mild symptoms,\" Hancock said. ",
            "The hospital activated \"additional protocols\" prior to the patient's arrival under the CDC's guidance. The patient was \"privately escorted through a secluded entrance to avoid common areas\" and kept under isolation. ",
            "This is the third case of the coronavirus confirmed among evacuees from China, following two cases in California. ",
            "It's the first case of the coronavirus confirmed in Texas. Eight cases have been confirmed in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. There are two instances of person-to-person transmission: one in Illinois and one in California.",
            "Earlier this week, 195 evacuees were released from federally mandated quarantine at March Air Reserve Base in California. No one in that group had tested positive for the novel coronavirus",
            "According to the CDC, more than 600 people evacuated from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, remain quarantined in the United States.",
            "CDC director expects coronavirus to be around 'beyond this year'",
            "In an interview Thursday with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CDC Director Robert R. Redfield indicated he doesn't believe the coronavirus is going away soon. ",
            "\"This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission,\" Redfield said. \"You can start to think of it in the sense like seasonal flu.\" ",
            "More research is needed to fully understand the coronavirus, but Redfield said the CDC has focused on surveillance to track cases and containment to slow down the virus' progression in the United States.",
            "The coronavirus can be spread by patients who are not exhibiting symptoms, Redfield said, based on information from colleagues in China.",
            "\"What we don't know, though, is how much of the asymptomatic cases are driving transmission,\" he said. ",
            "The CDC has not been invited to China to assist with the outbreak, Redfield said, nearly six weeks after the CDC first offered. ",
            "\"That letter has not been responded to yet by the official Chinese government,\" he said. \"We do believe that we're the best in the world in this space and we're ready to help and assist them, but they're an independent nation that has to make that decision that they're going to invite us in.\"",

            "Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Corporation tumbled in morning trading in New York, at times sliding as much as 5%.",
            "The drop came as two Italian media outlets reported a woman and her husband from Hong Kong were each being kept in solitary confinement in the hospital section of an unidentified Costa Cruises ship. The cruiseliner, a Carnival subsidiary, plans to keep the remaining passengers and crew aboard the ship until the couple tests negative for the infection.",
            "A spokesperson for Costa Cruises told CNN that a 54-year-old woman aboard the ship had a fever, a symptom of the virus. ",
            "\"All the other passengers are, at the moment, remaining on board,\" the spokesperson said. ",
            "The coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, has killed 170 people as of Thursday morning and there are 7,800 diagnosed worldwide. ",
            "China's government put travel restrictions in certain places across the country in an attempt to contain the virus. More than 60 million people are affected. ",
            "In a Jan. 28 securities filing, Carnival (CCL) said these measures led it to suspend operations from Chinese ports from Jan. 25 to Feb. 4, resulting in nine cruise line cancellations. The company also said the restrictions could cause Chinese clients to cancel bookings for cruises that sail from outside of China. ",
            "Fallout from the coronavirus could cut earnings by $0.03 to $0.04 per share, Carnival said, and by $0.05 to $0.06 if the restrictions extend until the end of February. The Miami-based firm had expected to deploy 5% of its global capacity in China in fiscal year 2020.",
            "Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean (RCL) said it has canceled three sailings until Feb. 8, saying this would have an impact on its 2020 financial results of about $0.10 per share, and double that if travel restrictions remain in place until the end of February. ",
            "A spokesperson for Norwegian (NCLH) said the company wasn't changing its itineraries and that it was checking the temperature of all passengers boarding in Hong Kong. Anyone with a fever of 100.4\u00b0F or higher will not be allowed to board, nor will any guests who visited mainland China in the last 30 days. ",

            "Hong Kong (CNN)Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the 2003 SARS crisis, Zhong Nanshan, one of the heroes in China's fight against that disease, described it as a \"turning point\" for the nation. ",
            "\"SARS forced the whole country to pay attention to the livelihood of the people,\" he said, before adding a warning. \"We've made huge progress, but our footsteps are slow, especially in terms of healthcare.\" ",
            "With the Wuhan coronavirus spreading across the country, killing at least 25 people so far, China is now facing a major test of just how much it has changed since 2003, both in terms of the healthcare system's ability to react to a new deadly pathogen -- and crucially, how the central government handles the developing crisis. ",
            "Speaking this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered \"all-out efforts\" to contain the virus' spread and treat those affected. His intervention seemed to carry with it a clear message: the mistakes of SARS will not be repeated. ",
            "Wuhan is only the latest crisis to face Xi since he secured personal control of the Communist Party, joining the US-China trade war, ongoing anti-government unrest in Hong Kong, and the recent Taiwan election, in which Tsai Ing-wen, much loathed by Beijing, handily won reelection against a more pro-China candidate. ",
            "More than any leader since Mao Zedong, Xi has centralized power around himself. He is the state, and while this gives him immense control, it also means that every crisis is a test of his leadership -- Wuhan perhaps most of all, as the country looks to their leader for reassurance and confidence. ",
            "Since Xi's statement, efforts to control the virus have ramped up nationwide, with health authorities ordering the highest level response, typically used to tackle outbreaks of plague or cholera. On Thursday, Wuhan itself -- all 11 million people -- was partially quarantined, with public transport \"temporarily suspended,\" including all planes and trains departing the city.",
            "In state media, editorials urged greater transparency and lauded the central government's quick response and that of Chinese scientists and doctors, who quickly released the virus' genome in order to aid the work of other researchers worldwide in coming up with a vaccine. ",
            "Despite the laudatory efforts of Chinese healthcare workers, however, and forceful statements from Beijing, allegations of an initial -- and potentially even ongoing -- cover-up continue to hang over the Wuhan outbreak. ",
            "This virus could have been China's chance to exorcise the ghosts of SARS once and for all, instead it may have exposed that, for all the progress in the past 17 years, fundamental flaws remain in place when it comes to handling a crisis like this -- ones that could result in far greater danger in future. ",
            "Crisis and cover-up ",
            "The first cases of what would later be called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were identified in southern China in November 2002. The virus would go on to infect more than 8,000 people worldwide, the majority of them in China. ",
            "Even as the deadly pathogen spread throughout Guangdong province, however, media reports were censored and patients and their families prevented from speaking out. If they addressed the issue at all, officials downplayed it, unwilling to risk upsetting the economy or \"social stability\" -- important metrics for future promotion. ",
            "It was not until whisteblower Jiang Yanyong, a retired Chinese army doctor, came forward in early 2003 that much of China and the rest of the world became aware of the true danger -- by which time SARS had already spread widely. The virus was soon declared a \"global threat\" by the World Health Organization (WHO) and efforts to contain its spread were put in place worldwide. ",
            "In the months that followed, China's government officially apologized for its slow reporting of the outbreak, and the country's health minister was sacked, along with the mayor of Beijing at the time. \"Never again\" was the message of the day, one that has been repeated ad nauseum regarding the Wuhan virus. ",
            "While the Communist Party's grasp on power in China has grown stronger than ever under Xi, it's popular legitimacy is much more fragile. The SARS scandal, and similarly mishandled crises such as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, had a devastating effect on that legitimacy, greatly alarming officials who place \"stability\" above all else. ",
            "Xi's gathering of power around himself also means the Wuhan crisis will be more of a test of his personal control of the Party and country -- and of the highly-centralized system he's put in place in recent years. ",
            "Initial problems ",
            "By a number of measures, China's handling of the current crisis has been infinitely better than during SARS. Authorities in Wuhan alerted the public to the new virus in mid-December, soon after the first cases were identified. Xi's statement four weeks later drastically boosted the response and publicized the risk. ",
            "In 2003, by comparison, it was over two months after the first patients were diagnosed with SARS that the WHO was alerted -- by a whistleblower, not the Chinese authorities -- of a \"strange contagious disease\" that has \"already left more than 100 people dead.\"",
            "But behind this outwardly competent handling of a crisis there are signs of a deeper problem. ",
            "One of the oldest cliches in Chinese politics is that \"the mountains are high and the emperor is far away.\" Despite being an intensely centralized state, provincial authorities do not always act as Beijing would prefer, nor do commandments from on high -- to crack down on corruption or reign in pollution, or to increase transparency -- always trickle down to the provinces.",
            "While unconfirmed, there are numerous indications that officials in Wuhan downplayed the risks of the virus for several weeks, delaying proper action and potentially increasing its spread.",
            "Though the first case was detected on December 8 -- it was not until January 14 that officials in Wuhan introduced any screening measures. In the intervening period, a major meeting of the Hubei provincial party was held in the city, and more than 40,000 families were invited to attend a banquet in an attempt to set a world record. ",
            "Speaking to state media, Wuhan officials downplayed the danger, saying the virus was unlikely to be spread from human to human. State officials initially repeated this assessment: Wang Guangfa, head of a team of researchers sent from Beijing to investigate the situation, said on January 11 that it was under control -- he has since been diagnosed with the virus. ",
            "At the same time, Wuhan authorities also tried to clamp down on discussion of the virus. State media reported that police arrested eight people in early January for spreading \"rumors\" that the virus was related to SARS, something which has since been confirmed by health authorities. ",
            "Even as researchers in the UK estimated that the initial spread of the virus could have affected at least 1,700 people, no new cases were reported in Wuhan itself, despite patients being identified in other countries. \"Does the virus only affect overseas travelers?\" people asked darkly on Chinese social media, where accusations of a cover-up quickly spread and were censored. ",
            "It was not until inspectors sent from Beijing had assessed the situation that the alarm was properly raised. In an interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Zhong Nanshan, the SARS hero, said there was \"definitely human-to-human transmission,\" and warned the infection rate was \"climbing.\" ",
            "Worst possible timing",
            "Speaking to state media this week, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted that the city's \"warnings were not sufficient.\" ",
            "Whether because of bureaucratic incompetence or a politically-motivated cover-up, the delay could not have come at a worse time. China is currently in the middle of the Lunar New Year travel rush, in which hundreds of millions of people move across the country, packed close together on trains, coaches and planes. ",
            "Revelations about the true spread and severity of the virus only came after the four-week travel period had got underway, and restrictions on people leaving Wuhan itself did not come into place until Thursday. One woman identified as having the virus in South Korea even told health officials there that she visited a doctor in Wuhan with symptoms -- after screening measures were introduced -- but got sent on her way and was able to leave the country.",
            "The pervasive censorship of the Chinese press and internet undoubtedly played a role in this, as did Xi's years-long crackdown on civil society groups, forcing people to rely on official accounts and the transparency of officials whose own motivations are often completely apposite. ",
            "Once Xi intervened, essentially signaling that the Wuhan virus was fair game for Chinese media, reporters rushed to the scene. Both Caixin and the Beijing News -- some of the most independently minded outlets in the country -- quickly began producing in-depth coverage, some of which exposed oversights by local officials and punched holes in their narrative. Writing on WeChat from Wuhan, Caixin reporter Gao Yu compared the situation to SARS, saying that \"the lack of transparency, public supervision and truth (have) caused huge damage to public safety.\"",
            "China learned hard lessons in 2003 at a terrible cost. The legacy of SARS could be seen in the central government's response this month, and that of Chinese scientists, both of which deserve a great deal of credit. ",
            "But Xi has also reversed gradual liberalization and opening up which occurred post-SARS, massively centralizing power within the Communist Party once again. At the same time, he has overseen a crackdown on the internet, the press and civil society, and an anti-corruption purge that, while it has turfed out plenty of bad apples, may also have left provincial officials more afraid of angering Beijing. ",
            "Xi is the closest China has had to an emperor since Mao, but like the old saying goes, he's often far away. The Wuhan virus shows what happens when the country has to rely on information filtering up to the top for decisive action to be taken. ",

            " (CNN)A Canadian citizen was turned away at the northern border as a part of President Donald Trump's temporary ban on people who have visited China before their arrival in the United States, acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said Monday.",
            "In the wake of Trump's proclamation, the US has started denying entry to foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival to the US. It's not clear whether anyone else has been turned back as part of the restrictions that began at 5 p.m. ET Sunday.",
            "\"We're just beginning, today, to see results of implementation,\" said Cuccinelli, who serves on the President's coronavirus task force.",
            "Airlines are responsible for stopping passengers who will be denied entry into the US before they get on planes, and DHS worked with the airlines throughout the weekend and collected feedback to make it \"more operationally feasible for them,\" Cuccinelli said. \"We recognize these are burdens on the airlines, as they are on other people as well. But we want to make it work as effectively as we can.\"",
            "The President, Cuccinelli said, based his decision on task force advice to implement certain measures to restrict travel of non-Americans who are most likely to have come in contact with coronavirus.",
            "\"The President made very clear his top priority is the safety of the American people, but that doesn't mean a complete shutdown,\" he said.",
            "As a practical matter, planes in the air at 5 p.m. ET were treated under pre-5 p.m. ET rules, Cuccinelli said, adding that they \"didn't want to be rerouting planes\" and they \"wanted that all to work smoothly and above all safely without breaking the system.\"",
            "Two key determinations",
            "US citizens and others who are allowed to travel to the US from China are being funneled to 11 airports where US authorities will conduct extra screening and transfer people for quarantine if needed.",
            "All flights from China will go to those airports, and passengers who have been to China in the past 14 days and weren't already traveling to one of those airports will be required to rebook their flights.",
            "The \"vast majority\" of flights coming from China already arrive at those airports, Cuccinelli said. ",
            "DHS has the statutory authority to limit the locations where all flights entering the US from abroad may land. And the Transportation Security Administration, under DHS, has required air carriers to enforce the President's proclamation that limits who is allowed to board commercial flights headed for the US. ",
            "When passengers arrive at the 11 airports, Customs and Border Protection officers make two key determinations: whether a traveler is admissible to the US and if someone needs extra screening or quarantine.",
            "If Customs and Border Protection determines extra screening is needed, travelers are sent for a secondary screening. By the end of the week, Cuccinelli said, he expects medical professionals at the airport secondary screening to be entirely staffed from DHS contracts. Coast Guard personnel are also doing the work at some airports. ",
            "Cuccinelli said the \"very small number of people who have either traveled to Hubei province or show symptoms\" will go to a third screening. At that point, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would get involved to connect people with local authorities and possible quarantine. ",

            "London (CNN Business)Nearly two decades have passed since a coronavirus known as SARS emerged in China, killing hundreds of people and sparking panic that sent a chill through the global economy. The virus now rampaging across China could be much more damaging. ",
            "China has become an indispensable part of global business since the 2003 SARS outbreak. It's grown into the world's factory, churning out products such as the iPhone and driving demand for commodities like oil and copper. The country also boasts hundreds of millions of wealthy consumers who spend big on luxury products, tourism and cars. China's economy accounted for roughly 4% of world GDP in 2003; it now makes up 16% of global output.",
            "SARS sickened 8,098 people and killed 774 before it was contained. The new coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has already killed more than 900 people and infected over 40,000 across at least 25 countries and territories. Chinese officials have locked down Wuhan and several other cities, but the virus continues to spread. ",
            "\"The outbreak has the potential to cause severe economic and market dislocation. But the scale of the impact will ultimately be determined by how the virus spreads and evolves, which is almost impossible to predict, as well as how governments respond,\" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. ",
            "Compounding the risk is the fact that the world outside China has also changed since 2003. ",
            "Globalization has encouraged companies to build supply chains that cut across national borders, making economies much more interconnected. The major central banks have used up much of the ammunition they would typically deploy to fight economic downturns since the 2008 financial crisis, and global debt levels have never been higher. Rising nationalism may make it harder to coordinate a worldwide response, if that's required. ",
            "The virus is snarling supply chains and disrupting companies.",
            "Car plants across China have been ordered to remain closed following the Lunar New Year holiday, preventing global automakers Volkswagen (VLKAF), Toyota (TM), Daimler (DDAIF), General Motors (GM), Renault (RNLSY), Honda (HMC) and Hyundai (HYMTF) from resuming operations in the world's largest car market. According to S&P Global Ratings, the outbreak will force carmakers in China to slash production by about 15% in the first quarter. Toyota said on Friday it would keep its factories shut at least until February 17.",
            "Luxury goods makers, which rely on Chinese consumers who spend big at home and while on vacation, have also been hit. British brand Burberry (BBRYF) has closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China, and its chief executive warned Friday that the virus is causing a \"material negative effect on luxury demand.\" Dozens of global airlines have curtailed flights to and from China.",
            "Even more troubling is the threat to global supply chains. Qualcomm (QCOM), the world's biggest maker of smartphone chips, warned that the outbreak was causing \"significant\" uncertainty around demand for smartphones, and the supplies needed to produce them. Already, auto parts shortages have forced Hyundai (HYMTF) to close plants in South Korea and caused Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to make contingency plans to avoid the same result at one of its plants in Europe.",
            "Economists say the current level of disruption is manageable. If the number of new coronavirus cases begins to slow, and China's factories reopen soon, the result will be a fleeting hit to the Chinese economy in the first quarter and a dent in global growth. If the virus continues to spread, however, the economic damage will increase rapidly. ",
            "Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz (ALIZF), told CNN Business that he was most worried about the potential cascading economic effects.",
            "\"They first paralyze the region of the virus outbreak,\" he said. \"Then they gradually spread domestically, undermining internal trade, consumption, production and the movement of people. If the virus is still not contained, the process spreads further, including regionally and internationally by disrupting trade, supply chains and travel.\"",
            "Epidemic risk",
            "Economists have a hard time working out the potential costs of epidemics because of their unique characteristics. ",
            "Yet diseases can be far more damaging than natural disasters such as hurricanes or a tsunami, or other unpredictable events known as \"black swans.\" According to a study by the World Bank, a severe pandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5% of global GDP, or more than $3 trillion. Losses from a weaker flu pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 virus, can still wipe 0.5% off global GDP. ",
            "\"A severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden, profound, and widespread impact,\" the World Bank assessed in a report on pandemics from 2013. (The Wuhan coronavirus has not been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.)",
            "The virus is not the driving factor behind those losses, however. Instead, it's the way consumers, businesses and governments respond to an outbreak that matters most.",
            "People are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick, preventing them from traveling, shopping and working. Doing so limits demand for consumer goods and energy. Decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories, meanwhile, curtail production. ",
            "\"This is continuing to grow in scope and magnitude. It could end being really, really big, and really, really serious. We can't project that now,\" said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who spent 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council.",
            "According to Shearing, past epidemics show that China's economy is likely to take a significant hit in the first quarter. But that will quickly fade from memory if the virus is contained.",
            "\"As long as factory closures don't lead to job losses, by this time next year the level of GDP is unlikely to be very different from what it would have been without the virus,\" he said.",
            "What can be done?",
            "China's government has moved quickly to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus and the measures taken to contain it. ",
            "The People's Bank of China cut a key interest rate this week and injected huge amounts of cash into markets in order to help take the pressure off banks and borrowers. Officials have also announced new tax breaks and subsidies designed to help consumers. ",
            "Yet China is also more vulnerable to a crisis than it was 17 years ago when SARS broke out.",
            "\"It has much higher debt, trade tensions with a major trading partner and its growth has been steadily slowing down for a number of years, which gives a weak starting point to face such a crisis,\" said Raphie Hayat, a senior economist at Dutch bank Rabobank.",
            "Analysts at Capital Economics expect the government to announce additional measures in the coming days. If the virus keeps spreading, they believe that Beijing will have to abandon its long-running efforts to get its debt under control and pump money directly into the economy.",
            "Central banks in neighboring countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines have cut interest rates in recent weeks. South Korea and Taiwan could be next.",
            "But the big powers of the financial world are exhausted from a decade fighting anemic growth since the global financial crisis. The European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates in 2014 and hasn't been able to increase them since, while the Bank of Japan is in a similar position. The US Federal Reserve already cut interest rates three times last year; Chair Jerome Powell has said he's carefully monitoring the situation.",
            "Meanwhile, debt levels have soared in the United States, Japan and key European countries including Italy, limiting the scope for a big fiscal stimulus if the world economy goes into another tailspin. Global debt, including borrowing by households, governments and companies, has jumped to more than three times the size of the global economy, the highest ratio on record, according to the Institute of International Finance. ",
            "Also critical is whether governments are able to coordinate their response to the outbreak, ideally with help from multinational institutions. This is especially true because, according to the World Bank, preparedness for a potential pandemic is low. But coordination may prove difficult in a increasingly fractured world where nationalism is often prized over cooperation.",
            "\"It's quite clear that multinational institutions are under more pressure, and have less teeth on day to day issues than 10 years ago,\" Shearing said. \"But the optimist in me would like to think that in the face of a global pandemic, global institutions are still in a position to respond.\"",

            " (CNN)A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans. ",
            "\"What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals,\" Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, said. ",
            "It's not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be, but fatality rates are currently lower than both MERS and SARS. Experts stress that it will change as the outbreak develops.",
            "The World Health Organization offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including how to monitor for the sick and how to treat patients. Here's what you should know about coronaviruses. ",
            "What is a coronavirus?",
            "Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "Coronavirus symptoms",
            "The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.",
            "For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis. ",
            "There are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly.",
            "Middle East respiratory syndrome, also known as the MERS virus, was first reported in the Middle East in 2012 and also causes respiratory problems, but those symptoms are much more severe. Three to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms. First identified in the Guangdong province in southern China, according to the WHO, it causes respiratory problems but can also cause diarrhea, fatigue, shortness of breath, respiratory distress and kidney failure. Depending on the patient's age, the death rate with SARS ranged from 0-50% of the cases, with older people being the most vulnerable.",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus is currently thought to be more mild than SARS and MERS and takes longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit the hospital, explains Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford. So far, around 15% to 20% of cases have become severe, requiring, for example, ventilation in the hospital.",
            "How it spreads",
            "Viruses can spread from human contact with animals. Scientists think MERS started in camels, according to the WHO. With SARS, scientists suspected civet cats were to blame. Officials do not yet know what animal may have caused the current outbreak in Wuhan.",
            "When it comes to human-to-human transmission of the viruses, often it happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough. ",
            "Depending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient's waste, according to the CDC.",
            "Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the Wuhan coronavirus, but experts are now trying to understand who is transmitting it most, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community. SARS and MERS were largely transmitted inside hospitals, Horby said. Some people are also considered to be \"superspreaders.\"",
            "Who is affected?",
            "MERS, SARS and the Wuhan coronavirus appear to cause more severe disease in older people, though uncertainty remains around the latest outbreak. Of the cases of Wuhan coronavirus reported so far, none are yet confirmed to be among children, Horby said. The average age is people 40 or over, he said.  ",
            "Coronavirus treatment",
            "There is no specific treatment, but research is underway. Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor. ",
            "Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough. ",
            "Drink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible.",
            "Should you worry about the Wuhan coronavirus?",
            "The Wuhan coronavirus fatality rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, but still comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, explains  Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London.",
            "\"It is a significant concern, globally,\" Ferguson says, noting that we don't fully understand the severity. ",
            "Ferguson believes the fatality rate is likely to be lower due to an \"iceberg\" of milder cases we are yet to find, but he highlights that novel viruses spread much faster through a population. ",
            "How can you can prevent it?",
            "There is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses, at least not yet. Trials for a MERS vaccine are underway. The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus, but it will be months until clinical trials get underway and more than a year until it might become available. ",
            "You may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds.",
            "Awareness is key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be the Wuhan coronavirus due to travel to the region or coming into contact with someone who has been there, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.",
            "Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.",
            "If traveling to China, be aware of symptoms and avoid live animal markets, which is where the latest outbreak began in Wuhan.",
            "Coronavirus and pregnancy",
            "In pregnant women, the more severe versions of MERS and SARS coronaviruses can be serious. There are cases in which a woman infected with MERS had a stillbirth, a 2014 study showed. ",
            "SARS-associated illnesses were linked to cases of spontaneous abortion, maternal death and critical maternal illness, a 2004 study found.",
            "Coronavirus and cats, dogs and other animals",
            "Pets can catch coronaviruses and the infections can become severe. Sometimes the viruses can lead to deadly diseases. One can cause feline infectious peritonitis in cats and something called a pantropic canine coronavirus can infect cats and dogs, according to a 2011 study. ",
            "Cats can catch SARS, but none of the infected cats developed symptoms, according to the study. The feline coronavirus typically is asymptomatic, but can cause mild diarrhea. Feline infectious peritonitis, or FIP, can cause flu-like symptoms for a cat, but can also be more serious for cats and can cause organ failure, but it is not contagious and will not spread from animal to animal or person to person.",
            "Pantropic canine coronavirus that can impact cats and dogs can be fatal to dogs, studies show.",
            "These particular dog and cat viruses don't seem to spread to humans.",

People with no medical training might wear it incorrectly, Popescu said. ",

            "\"Certainly, when you speak, sometimes you'll spit a little bit,\" Rimoin said. \"You'll rub your nose. You'll touch your mouth. You'll rub your eyes. And then you'll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.\"",

            "All of the Western automakers operate the plants through joint ventures with Chinese automakers, including GM's partner SAIC and Dongfeng Motor Corporation, one of the country's largest auto groups. The GM-SAIC plant in Wuhan has about 6,000 employees, about 10% of GM's total work force in China.",
            "The city of 11 million people, is under partial lockdown after its airport and railway stations were closed to departing passengers on Thursday as fear over the outbreak spread. All public transport services in the city have been suspended, and some of the main highways closed. ",

The global auto industry is in a deep recession, which shows few signs of abating. The number of cars sold in China, the world's largest market, fell by 2.3 million in 2019, according to LMC Automotive. Chinese officials have said sales could fall again this year. ",

Other Asian territories, particularly Hong Kong, have struggled to maintain supply of masks, with many stores running out following an initial rush by residents to stock up. ",

Russia said it was closing its border in the Far East, and limiting rail services from all of China from January 31. Meanwhile, North Korea declared a state of emergency and said it was instituting a \"hygienic and anti-epidemic\" response. ",
            "Facing a long quarantine",
            "Much of Hubei has been under effective quarantine for weeks now, with almost every city facing travel restrictions in a province home to nearly 60 million people. Wuhan has been completely locked down, with residents cooped up in their homes and the streets abandoned. ",
            "Foreigners being airlifted out of the city are also facing up to two weeks of mandatory or voluntary quarantine once they land in their home countries. ",
            "However, this has sparked controversy in some countries, especially in Australia, where a plan to house evacuees in a former detention center for migrants on Christmas Island has generated no small amount of negative publicity . ",
            "Public broadcaster ABC spoke to some Australians in Wuhan who said they would rather remain in the city than face two weeks on what has been described by some opposition lawmakers as a \"leper camp,\" even as Canberra defended its decision as the only place capable of quarantining hundreds of people.

            "\"You're not obligated to leave (when the 72 hours are up), so they're saying that the best thing for you, your people, your family and the community is to stay as long as possible,\" Evans said.",
            "After flying out of near-freezing temperatures in Wuhan, Evans said he and the other passengers were spending time outdoors enjoying the sunny, 22 degrees Celsius (72F) weather.  ",
            "\"We're all still taking major precautions. So it's not like we're around here hugging each other and shaking hands and things like that,\" Evans said. \"We're wearing our masks ... But honestly, you know, everyone is enjoying themselves because what we experienced, what we've seen, is very serious, you know, people are dying. So when you see that and think about things like that, try to take as much appreciation of what is in front of you.\"",

We have full confidence and capability to win this fight against the epidemic.\"",
            "China has taken major measures to try and contain the epidemic, locking much of Hubei down, partially closing the border with Hong Kong and extending the Lunar New Year holiday, all of which could have a severe drain on the country's economy, already vulnerable due to the US-China trade war.

            "Hong Kong (CNN)Governments around the world have always struggled to stop the spread of disease, from the deadly swine flu which struck the globe in 2009, to ongoing attempts to rein in Ebola in West Africa. ",
            "No health authority has ever tackled the challenge currently faced by China, however, as the country grapples with a new coronavirus just as hundreds of millions prepare to travel during the Lunar New Year period -- the largest annual human migration on Earth. ",
            "During the Lunar holiday, people from across the country will cram themselves into homebound trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Others will take advantage of the time off to holiday overseas. Last year, close to 7 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad for Lunar New Year, according to state media. ",
            "The holiday -- the most important in the Chinese calendar -- comes at the worst possible time for health authorities racing to contain the outbreak which has put the rest of Asia on alert. ",
            "The virus, which was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, is known to have infected more than 300 people and spread to at least three other countries already. On Monday, China's National Health Commission confirmed that the Wuhan coronavirus can be passed from human-to-human and that medical staff had also been infected.",
            "The spread of the mysterious respiratory virus to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, is fueling fears of a broader epidemic, as China enters its busiest travel period of the year.",
            "\"One of the consequences of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly than was the case 50 years ago,\" said Mike Turner, director of science at the Wellcome Trust, a UK-based global health charity.",
            "More cases have also been reported within China, evidence that the outbreak has spread well beyond Wuhan, creating a risk of unpredictable further infection. ",
            "As of Tuesday morning, five cases have been confirmed in Beijing, two in Shanghai, and 14 in the southern province of Guangdong -- all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Additional suspected cases have been reported across the country, from eastern Shandong province to Sichuan province in the southwest.",
            "Chinese scientists on January 8 identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus, the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In 2002 and 2003, SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia, spreading as far as Canada.",
            "During a news conference Monday, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese government-appointed expert who helped discover the SARS coronavirus, said the infectiousness of the new Wuhan coronavirus was not as strong as SARS, but that the disease was \"climbing\" and suggested that the \"death rate at the moment is not so representative.\" Since December, four people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus have died.",
            "Uncertainties about the Wuhan coronavirus -- including its unidentified source -- have prompted fears there may be more people infected than currently reported. ",
            "Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert who heads the Wellcome Trust, said the outbreak is \"extremely concerning.\"",
            "\"It is possible that often mild symptoms, and probability of people being affected and infectious without experiencing symptoms, from this coronavirus may be masking the true numbers of people who have been infected, and the extent of person to person transmission,\" said Farrar. ",
            "Initial symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus include fever and coughing -- which are also common flu symptoms, a viral infection prevalent in the winter months. Some patients infected with the coronavirus also have difficulty breathing and invasive lesions on the lungs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).",
            "The WHO will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the outbreak in China.",
            "Transportation hub",
            "The recent spike in confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases appears to point to a wider area of contamination. According to a recent study by Imperial College London, the number of infections in Wuhan itself are likely a gross underestimation, raising the risk that carriers of the virus may have already traveled elsewhere within China before screening measures were put in place. ",
            "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday that since the outbreak, China has been taking active measures to handle the epidemic and formulate prevention and control plans. ",
            "China's National Health Commission said Sunday that the situation of the outbreak is \"still preventable and controllable.\"",
            "The more than 200 cases officially confirmed in China is a far cry from the 1,700 the British researchers estimate to have been infected by January 12. The UK team based their calculations on the number of cases reported already in Thailand and Japan, and the estimated number of people departing Wuhan's international airport. ",
            "More than 60 routes connect Wuhan with other countries, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. The central city of 11 million people is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network. ",
            "Governments around the world have begun responding to the perceived threat. On Tuesday, Australia said it is adding border measures for flights from Wuhan to Sydney. The US also announced screening measures for passengers arriving from Wuhan at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles last week, following similar measures taken by governments in Asia. ",
            "In Wuhan itself, infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.",
            "Those measures were only put in place five weeks after the initial outbreak, meaning countless passengers have left the city without undergoing any screening.",
            "Nor is it clear that the screening or heightened attention in Wuhan is working: the woman diagnosed with the coronavirus in South Korea had visited a doctor in the city after developing a fever and muscle pains. She was prescribed cold medicine and sent on her way. ",
            "Cover-up concerns",
            "The legacy of SARS hangs long over the current outbreak. During that pandemic, the Chinese government was initially slow to release information, censoring news and downplaying the severity of the outbreak. The lack of transparency sparked backlash at home and drew heavy criticism from foreign governments and the WHO.",
            "In April 2003, a prominent doctor in Beijing went on the record to accuse the government of a coverup. Later in the month, China sacked its health minister and the mayor of Beijing over their mishandling of the outbreak.",
            "This time around, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission declared the outbreak on December 31, three weeks after the first patient developed symptoms. Chinese scientists identified the pathogen a week later and shared the genome sequence of the virus with the WHO -- a speedy response that earned praise from the WHO and scientists around the world.",
            "The Wuhan health commission has also been posting frequent -- and now daily -- updates on the latest infection numbers on its website, but that has failed to allay fears over the disease spreading.",
            "The Wuhan health commission announced Monday that 136 new cases had been diagnosed on Saturday and Sunday, including one death. The number was a significant jump from the 62 reported during the weekend, but far short of the estimate by the Imperial College London researchers.",
            "The WHO said the spike in reported cases was the result of \"increased searching and testing\" of the virus among people with respiratory illness.",
            "Before this weekend, Wuhan authorities had maintained for two weeks that no new cases had been detected since January 3. Even as cases were confirmed overseas, there was a complete lack of information on potential infections elsewhere in China, leading to a growing sense of unease and accusations of a coverup by local or national authorities. ",
            "On Weibo, a Twitter-like social media service, many people questioned the silence from the provincial authorities in particular, pointing out the unlikeliness that only those people who left the country were found to be carrying the virus. ",
            "\"Does it mean that Wuhan residents only travel abroad but not to other (Chinese) cities?\" one user asked in a popular post. ",
            "Increased concerns around person-to-person transmission, combined with the mass travel expected in the coming weeks, will have health authorities -- and the public -- on edge to see just how far the new virus spreads.",
            "On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed authorities to take \"resolute efforts\" to contain the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, the first time the country's leader has publicly spoken on the outbreak. ",
            "According to a statement carried on state news agency Xinhua, Xi \"stressed putting people's safety and health as the top priority\" and urged relevant departments to release information promptly and deepen international cooperation.",

            " (CNN)Starting today, you will notice that CNN is using the term pandemic to describe the current coronavirus outbreak. It is not a decision we take lightly. While we know it sounds alarming, it should not cause panic.",
            "So why now? The World Health Organization hasn't called the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Nor has the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "But many epidemiologists and public health experts argue the world is already experiencing a pandemic because of the novel coronavirus. There are now over 100,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths attributed to this new virus. In one day last week, the number of new cases outside of China, where the virus originated, was nearly 9 times higher than the number of new cases in China. This virus has found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica. In several countries, the number of cases continues to climb.Some of those countries \"have had sustained community transmission of a substantial sort,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Put that together, that spells pandemic.\"",
            "The specific criteria for a pandemic are not universally defined, but there are three general criteria: a virus that can cause illness or death; sustained person-to-person transmission of that virus; and evidence of spread throughout the world. The CDC says a pandemic is \"an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people,\" while an epidemic is \"an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.\"",
            "In late February, CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier said, \"The fact that this virus has caused illness -- including illness that has resulted in death -- and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria for a pandemic.\"",
            "\"As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer towards meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus.\"",
            "We have already seen community spread in the United States, but sustained spread means it continues through generations, when one person might spread the virus to two or three others, and then those people spread it to two or three more and so on.",
            "While there may be areas of the United States where coronavirus is more easily contained, the CDC says it's likely that widespread transmission of the virus will occur in the United States. ",
            "\"I think we're there,\" said Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch.  \"I think the definition you have there  ... an epidemic that's in multiple locations affecting a large number of people -- is the basic issue. And I might add, that's not under control in those places. I think all of those criteria are met.\"",
            "What to call this outbreak is, in part, a question of semantics. But it also speaks to specific actions being taken.",
            "It means the focus is not only on containment, but increasingly on the mitigation of the spread of the coronavirus. Already, US health officials are signaling a shift in the strategy.",
            "\"Ultimately we expect we will see community spread in this country. It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,\" Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said late last month. \"We will maintain, for as long as practical, a dual approach where we continue measures to contain this disease, but also employ strategies to minimize the impact on our communities.\"",
            "On Sunday, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told CNN, \"Initially, we had a posture of containment so that we could give people time to prepare for where we are right now. We're shifting into a mitigation phase, which means that we're helping communities understand you're going to see more cases. \"Unfortunately, you're going to see more deaths but that doesn't mean that we should panic.\"",
            " While mitigation does not preclude containment, it will mean anticipating and preparing for the surge of patients that will be entering hospitals. This -- not the daily case count -- is the most urgent issue facing the United States, as well as many other countries.",
            "The largest case studies out of China indicate that around 80% of those infected with the coronavirus had symptoms of a bad cold and are expected to recover. Another 14% became severely ill, and 5% percent became critically ill. People in their 70s and 80s were most likely to become severely or critically ill and pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, lung disease and hypertension also increased the risk.",
            " ",
            "\"It has been clear for several weeks that this would become a pandemic and now it has,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the CDC and current president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives. \"Every community in every country needs to prepare so that we can reduce both the health and societal consequences. Some pandemics are only mild or moderate, and it is still not certain how severe this will be, but it is certain that people who are older and medically vulnerable should take steps to distance themselves from others and reduce the risk that they become infected.\"",
            "According to estimates from the US Department of Health and Human Services that means even with a moderate outbreak, 200,000 people in the United States will need intensive care. The United States has less than 100,000 ICU beds. In a moderate pandemic, 64,000 people are projected to need mechanical ventilation -- breathing machines. The United States is estimated to have only about 62,000 full featured ventilators on hand and an additional 8,900 in the national stockpiled. Given that this is flu season, many of those are already in use. Shifting the dialogue toward pandemic preparedness means we should more directly and completely address these shortfalls.",
            "I take this shift in language very seriously, and I spent the last several days speaking to public health leaders, epidemiologists and clinicians about the terminology. While some were understandably conservative, everyone agreed that we are now in a pandemic.",
            "Now is the time to prepare for what may be ahead. That could mean quarantines, closed schools and cancelled events in your town. It might mean strain at work or taking a break from hobbies that usually bring you joy. It might mean putting off a family vacation or catching up over the phone instead of getting together.",
            "Humanity has overcome pandemics before. In this globally connected world, we may be asked to add more social distance between each other, but that doesn't mean we can't still collectively come together as a nation and as a world. This is a crisis we can overcome if we can work together.",

            "The agency acknowledges that it is challenging to contain the virus because of global mass movement.",

            "Current control measures in place include early case detection, early isolation and treatment of cases, contact tracing and social detention measures in places where there is risk of transmission, Briand said. These are the core elements of any outbreak response and might be enough to stop an infection from spreading.",
            "A pandemic is define as the worldwide spread of a new disease, but it's not quite as simple as that. The finer details are debated as many factors, including population immunity and disease severity, need to be taken into account.",
            "An epidemic is more than a normal number cases of an illness, specific health-related behavior or other health-related events in a community or region. A disease outbreak is the occurrence of disease cases in excess of what's normally expected, according to WHO. ",
            "The last pandemic reported was the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, which killed hundreds of thousand worldwide.",
            "WHO last week declared the novel coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, which it calls  \"an extraordinary event\" that constitutes a \"public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and \"to potentially require a coordinated international response.\" ",

            "The new virus has infected more than 20,000 people across 26 countries and territories and killed more than 420, but the majority of cases -- currently an estimated 78% -- are coming from Hubei province in China, Briand explained.",
            "\"This is the epicentre of the outbreak,\" she said during Tuesday's press conference.",
            "Briand described cases outside of Hubei as \"spillover cases\" -- people who were mostly infected in Hubei before there was a lockdown there and moved to other places with the disease, causing clusters of cases in other regions. The same can be said of the cases reported in other countries. ",
            "Briand believes that in Hubei and places that have spillover, \"we can stop transmission,\" which will prevent the situation from becoming a pandemic.",

            " (CNN)Scientists have said that a type of snake may be the original source of the Wuhan coronavirus. However, other infectious disease experts say the ultimate culprit is more likely to be the bat. ",
            "\"When you look at the genetic sequence of the virus, and you match it up with every known coronavirus, the closest relatives are from bats,\" said Dr. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, an environmental health non-profit.",
            "Professor Guizhen Wu of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a study released by the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday that the data they had so far was consistent with the virus being initially hosted by bats.",
            "The bat has long been seen as a biological super villain. ",
            "The winged mammal has been the reservoir for several different deadly viruses like Marburg, Nipah and Hendra, which have caused disease in humans and outbreaks in Uganda, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. Bats are thought to be the natural host of the Ebola virus, rabies, SARS and MERS, with the latter two both coronaviruses similar to the one that's now emerged in Wuhan.",
            "Often, there's an intermediary involved as was the case with SARS in 2003 \u2014 the civet cat \u2014 and MERS, which emerged later in the 2000s and was carried by camels. ",
            "Scientists call these viruses zoonotic because they are transmitted from animals to humans.",
            "In the case of Nipah virus, which can cause a range of symptoms including fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), infections were traced back to juice made from the sap of a date palm tree that had been contaminated by bat urine or saliva. Bats had been roosting in the trees where locals set up spigots to collect the tasty sap. ",
            "The fact this new coronavirus has been linked to bats \"comes as no surprise to virologists working on bat-borne viruses,\" said Dr Stathis Giotis, a virologist at the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College in London. \"Bats are recognized as important reservoirs for emerging and re-emerging viruses with zoonotic potential.\"",
            "Giotis said that it was possible that the Chinese horseshoe bat, a common bat species in China, was responsible.",
            "Why are bats so adept at harboring and spreading viruses?",
            "Bats are a diverse group, with more than 1,300 species, are second only to rodents in mammal diversity. They are geographically diverse, living on every continent except Antarctica. Compared with terrestrial animals, they have a longer lifespan and many roost densely with millions of others in caves, meaning they potentially come into contact with more viruses and they circulate easily between them. ",
            "While bats are known to carry several high-profile viruses, they don't seem to suffer from them \u2014 with the exception of rabies. ",
            "One theory posits that flight, which is shared by all bats but no other mammals, has allowed bats to evolve mechanisms that protect them from viruses. Flying elevates the bat's metabolism and body temperature \u2014 similar to a fever in humans and other mammals \u2014 and scientists say this, on an evolutionary scale, could boost a bat's immune system and make it more tolerant of viruses. ",
            "\"The current hypothesis among scientists is that the bat immune system has been adapted over centuries of evolution due to their flying ability,\" said Giotis.",
            "Scientists have found some promising leads in the animal's genetic make-up to back up this hypothesis.  ",
            "\"Key antiviral immunity components are conserved in bats, but some genes that activate inflammation or specialized-antiviral defense mechanisms are either missing or have altered function,\" said Giotis, explaining why they don't have a typical immune response to viruses.",
            "Of course, bats aren't the only animals that carry disease that spills over into humans. The plague was carried by rodents and HIV spilled over from chimpanzees. ",
            "Scientists in a 2017 paper did find that bats harbored more dangerous viruses than other species. A team of scientists including Daszak looked at 188 known zoonotic viruses and found that bats hosted a \"significantly higher\" proportion of these than other mammals.",
            "However, some scientists say that bats have been more extensively sampled for viruses in the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak and that other animals may have a similar diversity of viruses if scientists looked more robustly. ",
            "But deforestation and urbanization, especially in densely populated places like China, are putting humans into closer contact with bats and other animals, which allows the spillover of viruses, Giotis said. ",
            "Did the Wuhan virus spill over from bats?",
            "Scientists in China have actively been studying bats carefully given that they've long been thought to have the potential to be the starting point of the next pandemic.",
            "In a paper published last year, scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology made an eerily prescient observation: \"It is generally believed that bat-borne CoVs (coronaviruses) will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak,\" they said. \"In this regard, China is a likely hotspot. The challenge is to predict when and where, so that we can try our best to prevent such outbreaks.\"",
            "Daszak said that scientists have found about 50 SARS-related coronaviruses in bats all across China and the SARS coronavirus had been found in people in the southwestern province of Yunnan who lived near caves where the virus had been found in bats \u2014 although they showed no symptoms of respiratory illness during sampling.   ",
            "\"These viruses are a really high risk for pandemic emergence. They're in bats, they're across Southeast Asia, people are exposed to them regularly, and they're actually getting infected,\" Daszak said.",
            "It's too early to say for sure whether the Wuhan coronavirus originated in bats and whether an intermediary played a role. The outbreak was initially traced to a seafood market that sold live animals in Wuhan and scientists are working hard to trace the source both in the lab and in the field. ",
            "Wu at the Chinese Center for Disease Control said the data was pointing toward the virus going from bats to another, unknown wild animal, and then to humans. She said no bats were sold or found at the seafood market and the outbreak was first reported in late December when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. ",
            "\"There are initial, although contested, reports that the virus has already been detected in both bats and snakes and the strains in both bats and snakes are similar to each other and to the strains from human cases,\" Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre in London. ",
            "\"All the work around this new outbreak is new and ongoing which can explain why there are differing thoughts on what the source may be.\"",

            "George Magnus is an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University, a research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies, and former chief economist of UBS. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.",
            "The coronavirus epidemic that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has already infected an estimated 7,800 people and claimed 170 lives as of Thursday morning. Coinciding with the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across China, the outbreak has forced the authorities to at least partially shut down more than a dozen cities. ",
            "It will also undo much of the recently gained momentum of China's economy, which was expected to turn the corner during the first half of this year. ",
            "A public health scare on this scale is likely to have immediate economic repercussions for China's economy in three vital ways: a sharp downturn in the tourism and leisure industry as people cancel or avoid travel and events; a pause in spending, production and borrowing as uncertainty and travel restrictions impact businesses, jobs and consumer confidence; and higher costs related to measures introduced to mitigate the spread of infection, such as the extension of the holiday period, delays in people returning to work and health screenings.",
            "Travel",
            "Domestic and international travel is now substantially higher and more important to China's economy than when SARS dealt a harsh blow in 2003. But flight cancellations to China to contain the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, coupled with other costs, will likely cause serious economic damage. The short-term impact now depends critically on how bad the coronavirus infection becomes and how long it takes to control the outbreak and treat those infected.",
            "Over the longer term, or as soon as the virus is brought under control and the infection rate starts to decline, we should expect China's economy to normalize.",
            "Business confidence and production",
            "This is all happening at a difficult time for China. Toward the end of 2019, it looked as though the further easing of economic policies, such as an increase in infrastructure spending and looser monetary and budgetary policies, had allowed the economy to stabilize following a significant slowing in the summer and fall of last year. The slowdown, which has been going on for a few years, was accentuated by a clampdown on aggressive financial risk-taking and malpractice, rising debt burdens, higher pork prices arising from the outbreak of a virulent form of African swine fever and the burden of the trade war with the United States.",
            "The expected improvement in economic activity in the first half of 2020 is most unlikely to happen now. Indeed, growth may slide considerably, even if official data portray the economy as still growing at about the 6% government target. The reality is that China's economy is almost certainly growing below that rate, and that the cumulative effects of the current public health crisis will tend to drive the growth rate even lower in the near term. ",
            "Government trust",
            "Even though the economy should be expected to bounce back once the virus is brought under control, the real issue for China may be that citizens think that the political authorities were slow to share information about it. This would add to other political issues surrounding the government, including the detention camps in Xinjiang Province, the protests in Hong Kong, the recent election in Taiwan and the trade war with the United States.",
            "We shall have to see, once the public health scare is over, how the economy bounces back and whether the government tries to give it some additional help. But the lesson from this episode is not so much the economic costs of temporary shocks, which we can measure and are in some ways self-correcting. Rather it is the longer-term consequences for the economy of a highly centralized and authoritarian government, whose flaws have been further exposed by this health crisis.",

            " (CNN)Starting today, you will notice that CNN is using the term pandemic to describe the current coronavirus outbreak. It is not a decision we take lightly. While we know it sounds alarming, it should not cause panic.",
            "So why now? The World Health Organization hasn't called the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Nor has the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "But many epidemiologists and public health experts argue the world is already experiencing a pandemic because of the novel coronavirus. There are now over 100,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths attributed to this new virus. In one day last week, the number of new cases outside of China, where the virus originated, was nearly 9 times higher than the number of new cases in China. This virus has found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica. In several countries, the number of cases continues to climb.Some of those countries \"have had sustained community transmission of a substantial sort,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Put that together, that spells pandemic.\"",
            "The specific criteria for a pandemic are not universally defined, but there are three general criteria: a virus that can cause illness or death; sustained person-to-person transmission of that virus; and evidence of spread throughout the world. The CDC says a pandemic is \"an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people,\" while an epidemic is \"an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.\"",
            "In late February, CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier said, \"The fact that this virus has caused illness -- including illness that has resulted in death -- and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria for a pandemic.\"",
            "\"As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer towards meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus.\"",
            "We have already seen community spread in the United States, but sustained spread means it continues through generations, when one person might spread the virus to two or three others, and then those people spread it to two or three more and so on.",
            "While there may be areas of the United States where coronavirus is more easily contained, the CDC says it's likely that widespread transmission of the virus will occur in the United States. ",
            "\"I think we're there,\" said Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch.  \"I think the definition you have there  ... an epidemic that's in multiple locations affecting a large number of people -- is the basic issue. And I might add, that's not under control in those places. I think all of those criteria are met.\"",
            "What to call this outbreak is, in part, a question of semantics. But it also speaks to specific actions being taken.",
            "It means the focus is not only on containment, but increasingly on the mitigation of the spread of the coronavirus. Already, US health officials are signaling a shift in the strategy.",
            "\"Ultimately we expect we will see community spread in this country. It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,\" Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said late last month. \"We will maintain, for as long as practical, a dual approach where we continue measures to contain this disease, but also employ strategies to minimize the impact on our communities.\"",
            "On Sunday, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told CNN, \"Initially, we had a posture of containment so that we could give people time to prepare for where we are right now. We're shifting into a mitigation phase, which means that we're helping communities understand you're going to see more cases. \"Unfortunately, you're going to see more deaths but that doesn't mean that we should panic.\"",
            " While mitigation does not preclude containment, it will mean anticipating and preparing for the surge of patients that will be entering hospitals. This -- not the daily case count -- is the most urgent issue facing the United States, as well as many other countries.",
            "The largest case studies out of China indicate that around 80% of those infected with the coronavirus had symptoms of a bad cold and are expected to recover. Another 14% became severely ill, and 5% percent became critically ill. People in their 70s and 80s were most likely to become severely or critically ill and pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, lung disease and hypertension also increased the risk.",
            " ",
            "\"It has been clear for several weeks that this would become a pandemic and now it has,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the CDC and current president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives. \"Every community in every country needs to prepare so that we can reduce both the health and societal consequences. Some pandemics are only mild or moderate, and it is still not certain how severe this will be, but it is certain that people who are older and medically vulnerable should take steps to distance themselves from others and reduce the risk that they become infected.\"",
            "According to estimates from the US Department of Health and Human Services that means even with a moderate outbreak, 200,000 people in the United States will need intensive care. The United States has less than 100,000 ICU beds. In a moderate pandemic, 64,000 people are projected to need mechanical ventilation -- breathing machines. The United States is estimated to have only about 62,000 full featured ventilators on hand and an additional 8,900 in the national stockpiled. Given that this is flu season, many of those are already in use. Shifting the dialogue toward pandemic preparedness means we should more directly and completely address these shortfalls.",
            "I take this shift in language very seriously, and I spent the last several days speaking to public health leaders, epidemiologists and clinicians about the terminology. While some were understandably conservative, everyone agreed that we are now in a pandemic.",
            "Now is the time to prepare for what may be ahead. That could mean quarantines, closed schools and cancelled events in your town. It might mean strain at work or taking a break from hobbies that usually bring you joy. It might mean putting off a family vacation or catching up over the phone instead of getting together.",
            "Humanity has overcome pandemics before. In this globally connected world, we may be asked to add more social distance between each other, but that doesn't mean we can't still collectively come together as a nation and as a world. This is a crisis we can overcome if we can work together.",

After his morning run, Evans may settle in with his laptop in the hotel where he's staying on base and do some work for his business. If he were so inclined, he could even go to a Zumba or kickboxing class to pass the time. For the most part, though, he and everyone else at the hotel are keeping to themselves.",
            "They are under quarantine, after all. ",
            "Evans and 194 other people were evacuated from Wuhan aboard a chartered flight on January 28th to escape the rapidly spreading coronavirus that has claimed hundreds of lives and put the global community on high alert. ",
            "The passengers from Evans' flight are one of several groups of Americans that have been evacuated from Wuhan. So far, about 500 Americans have been ferried out of the country on chartered flights.",
            "Groups of Americans arriving from China have been taken to military bases, hotels or other sites to wait out a federally-mandated 72-hour waiting period. ",
            "From there, it's a long and sometimes monotonous waiting game. The March Air Base evacuees aren't beholden to any schedule, except for meal service times, twice-daily medical screenings and morning meetings with the health officials.",
            "Two weeks in limbo",
            "The 195 people on Evans' flight were ushered to March Air Base for their quarantine, one of the five military bases now being used for such purposes. A few hours after their arrival. a passenger from the flight was caught leaving the base, prompting the CDC to extend their quarantine. ",
            "So, Evans and some of his fellow evacuees are whiling away the hours until their two-week period ends.",
            "\"Everyone is doing pretty fine. People understand that the quarantine is necessary,\" Evans tells CNN. \"[They're] doing a good job keeping us busy and giving us all what we need.\" On-site case managers from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) were able to ship Evans' laptop to him so he could work. Children under quarantine have gotten toys to play with and can participate in organized activities to burn off their nervous energy. ",
            "However, the evacuees aren't able to leave the grounds of the base. No one else is staying in the hotel where they're being housed. And every day plays out under the watchful eye of health officials. ",
            " \"We get medical checks twice a day \u2014 in the morning and at night. In the morning you get your temperature checked,\" Evans says. \"We have a meeting at 10 am every day. It's with some of the medical officials who are here on the base and also with the [ACF] case managers.\" ",
            "The case managers are there to attend to the evacuees' needs, whether they be practical, like a work laptop, or more mental health-oriented.",
            "Citizens under federal quarantine are entitled to basic needs, like food and medical care. Evans says the food is nothing fancy, but it will do, and it's free. Breakfast is usually something like eggs, sausage and a muffin, and lunch could be a sandwich with chips and a pickle. ",
            "Playing the waiting game ",
            " Evans, who played football at the University of Cincinnati, moved to Wuhan two years ago to play football for the Chinese National Football League's Wuhan Berserkers. ",
            " He's facing a decision that a lot of other evacuees are probably weighing as well: Where to stay in the states while Wuhan battles the deadly virus that originated within its borders. Evans lives in Miami, but is originally from New York City, where he owns and operates a rideshare company. He'll probably stay with family there when he's allowed to leave.",
            " Once the quarantine is over, officials have offered to shuttle evacuees to Los Angeles International Airport so they can get on a flight and get back to their lives. ",
            " Until then, evacuees at the hotel are able to talk to their families as often as they'd like. Evans says his family isn'y necessarily worried, just waiting it out. \"As long as I am in good spirits when I talk to [my family], they're in good spirits too,\" Evans says. ",
            " \"We stay to ourselves in the evenings,\" Evans says.  \"We usually eat and then go back to our rooms and do our own thing. People just want to get out of here and get to their families. Everyone is respecting one another.\"",
            "\"No group hugs or shaking hands though,\" he adds. ",
            "Leaving behind a ghost town ",
            " A two-week quarantine may seem excessive for a disease that is still heavily localized in mainland China, but the Wuhan coronavirus has gotten exponentially more prevalent since it was first recorded in early December 2019. The virus has been confirmed in more than 25 countries and territories, and governments across the world have taken similar evacuation measures to get their citizens home and make sure the virus doesn't catch hold on their shores. ",
            "Evans says when he left Wuhan, there was no panic. There were no cars on the road. No people outside. ",
            "There was nothing. ",
            "\"It's still a ghost town,\" he says. ",
            "He's talked to friends who are still in Wuhan, and they say people are just trying to stay civilized while they endure the quarantine. At first, Evans says, the scene in Wuhan was chaotic. But now, most people stay inside their homes, hoping their stockpiles of food and supplies will get them through the worst of it. ",
            "In comparison, a few days holed up in a Southern California hotel seems like a small price to pay for health and safety.",

            "The new measures, announced by the People's Bank of China on Saturday, aim to contain the spread of the virus, officially known as Covid-19. There is still a lot unknown about the virus, which has infected more than 71,000 people globally and killed 1,775, the majority in China -- but it appears to survive for at least several hours on surfaces, according to the World Health Organization.",
            "This is why buildings in affected areas are regularly disinfecting elevator buttons, door handles, and other commonly-touched surfaces -- and why people are worried about cash, which changes hands multiple times a day.",
            "All Chinese banks must now literally launder their cash, disinfecting it with ultraviolet light and high temperatures, then storing it for seven to 14 days before releasing it to customers, said the central Chinese government in a press release Saturday.",
            "Cash that comes from high-risk infection areas, like hospitals and wet markets, will be \"specially treated\" and sent back to the central bank instead of being recirculated.",
            "And in the central bank's Guangzhou branch, these high-risk banknotes may be destroyed instead of merely disinfected, according to state-run tabloid Global Times.",
            "To make up for the supply, the bank will issue large amounts of new, uninfected cash; in January, the bank allocated 4 billion yuan (about $573.5 million) in new banknotes to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, said the government press release.",
            "Other measures includes suspending physical cash transfers between hard-hit provinces, to limit the possibility of virus transmission during the cash's transit.",
            "It's unclear how \"infected\" cash in China may actually be -- the virus likely dies after a few hours on surfaces, especially if it's been killed with disinfectant. And most people in urban centers don't use cash anyway -- mobile payment apps are near-ubiquitous. ",

            "To limit the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities have implemented a number of other drastic measures including placing 60 million people under full or partial lockdown. People aren't just afraid to touch money -- just going outside risks infection, so many have stayed at home for the past few weeks, only venturing out to buy groceries.",

An additional 45 people died in Hubei -- the province at the epicenter of the outbreak -- and one person died in the megacity of Chongqing on Friday, as the number of fatalities reached 259. ",

With most of China due to return to work on Monday, the concern will be how far the virus will now spread, and whether the country's economy can bear the type of further quarantines and travel restrictions that may be necessary to rein it in.",

            "Study author Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at University of Hong Kong, said in a statement that their predicted number could be much higher than confirmed cases because \"not everyone who is infected with (the virus) would require or seek medical attention,\" thus many may go uncounted.

            "But the decision has prompted anger from some exhausted passengers, who believe the move could actually set back their ability to return to normal life -- just as that option was within their grasp. ",
            "Thousands of people have been stuck in their cabins under mandatory quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess, which is docked off the Japanese port city of Yokohama, since February 3. With 356 confirmed cases of coronavirus on board, 70 of which were announced Sunday, the ship has the largest concentration of novel coronavirus cases outside mainland China. On February 19, the controversial quarantine period was set to finally end.",
            "Until Saturday, the US government seemed on board with that plan. The consensus among government agencies, which had been communicated to the more than 400 Americans aboard, was that remaining on the ship for the quarantine period was the best course of action. ",
            "Most passengers weren't thrilled but accepted the plan. ",
            "After the quarantine, virus-free passengers were told they could take commercial flights back to the US.",

            "That decision has prompted anger among the American passengers, with many demanding answers to two simple questions about the US response:  Why did the American government wait so long to make the about-face decision? What prompted such a dramatic shift in US policy? ",

            "University of Edinburgh infectious disease expert Mark Woolhouse told CNN: \"I don't think it's helpful to highlight an individual.\" That's because it's not clear how many people he actually infected, whether he \"sheds\" the virus more readily than any other person, or whether he was simply in contact with more people and thus, more likely to pass the virus on. Woolhouse prefers the term \"super spreading event.\"",

            "Despite the colossal effort -- and potential social and economic cost -- of effectively quarantining Hubei, it appears that this has come too late to stop the virus' spread.

            " (CNN)The novel coronavirus has been declared a public health emergency in the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a White House briefing on Friday.",
            "Once the declaration goes into effect at 5 p.m. ET Sunday, US citizens returning to the United States who have been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks before their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine, Azar said. ",
            "US citizens returning from the rest of mainland China in the two weeks prior will face a health screening at a select number of ports of entry, he said. Those citizens also face up to two weeks of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they pose no health risk. ",
            "President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last two weeks, Azar said, and could pose a risk of spreading the coronavirus. Foreign nationals who are the immediate family of US citizens or permanent residents are exempt. ",
            "\"These prudent, targeted and temporary actions will decrease the pressure on public health officials screening incoming travelers, expedite the processing of US citizens and permanent residents returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people,\" Azar said.  ",
            "\"I want to stress: the risk of infection for Americans remains low,\" he added. \"And with these and our previous actions we're working to keep the risk low.\"",
            "Azar's announcement came as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the seventh confirmed coronavirus case in the US. The seventh patient is an adult male in Santa Clara County in northern California, the third confirmed case in the state. ",
            "The man recently traveled to Wuhan, according to health officials. Upon returning to Northern California on January 24, the man self-isolated and did not leave home except to seek medical care, said Dr. Sara Cody, director of Santa Clara County's health department. He was not sick enough to be hospitalized.",
            "The health department is reaching out to everyone the man may have had contact with to determine if they may have been exposed to the virus.",
            "The outbreak has so far killed at least 258 people and infected more than 10,000 others in China, most of them in the Hubei province. There are at least 140 confirmed cases outside of mainland China.",
            "14-day quarantine ordered for evacuated Americans",
            "Earlier Thursday the CDC ordered a federal 14-day quarantine for the 195 Americans on an Air Force base in California recently evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.",
            "It's the first such order in more than 50 years.  ",
            "\"While we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented public health threat, and this is one of the tools in our toolbox to mitigate the potential impact of this novel virus on the United States,\" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ",
            "The group of 195 Americans, many of them diplomats and their families, arrived by plane Wednesday at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, California, and were staying at the base under a three-day voluntary quarantine. ",
            "US health officials previously said they wouldn't issue a blanket quarantine for the evacuees, as some agreed to stay at the base voluntarily longer than 72 hours.",
            "Then Thursday, one of the passengers tried to leave the base and was ordered to stay there in quarantine for a 14-day incubation period \"or until otherwise cleared,\" Riverside County Public Health said in a statement.",
            "A longtime CDC adviser told CNN Friday morning the agency should consider extending the three-day quarantine because other countries are doing the same for citizens returning from Wuhan. Those include France, South Korea and Australia. ",
            "The CDC adviser pointed to a report published Thursday night in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that infected people can transmit the virus before they develop symptoms.  ",
            "According to the study, there were five instances of asymptomatic transmission of the Wuhan virus in one cluster. A woman in Shanghai was infected by one of her parents, who had no symptoms. That woman flew to Germany and while she was asymptomatic transmitted the virus to two colleagues. One of those colleagues, while healthy, transmitted the virus to two more coworkers.  ",
            "The last time such a quarantine order was issued was in the 1960s for smallpox evaluation, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told reporters Friday.",
            "\"We believe that this approach of having a quarantine for the incubation period offers the greatest level of protection for the American public in preventing introduction and spread,\" Cetron said. \"That is our primary concern.\"",
            "'Is this a nightmare?'",
            "Jarred Evans, one of the 195 passengers from Wuhan, told CNN Thursday he \"will stay as long as I need\" at the military base.",
            "The passengers are wearing protective masks and are spending some time outdoors.",
            "\"We're all still taking major precautions. So, it's not like we're around here hugging each other and shaking hands and things like that,\" Evans said.",
            "Evans spent more than a week holed up in his apartment in Wuhan as coronavirus raced through Wuhan before he landed in the US on the chartered flight. During that time, he said, residents sent panicked messages, warning others to take precaution.",
            "\"It hit fast and ... it just was very hectic for, like, three days straight,\" he said. \"I got the news from my Chinese friends saying, 'Hey, stay inside. Wear a mask. Don't go outside, stock up on some food because this is going to get serious.' And as you can see, it's very serious.\"",
            "\"When you're there and there's no transportation, no trains, no subways, no planes, the military is blocking off each and every aspect of the road. No Ubers, nothing. Mom and pop stores are closed. You think to yourself, like, is this real? Is this a movie? Is this a nightmare?\" he said.",

            "Saudi Arabia, seeking to cushion the blow from the coronavirus, proposed further production cuts during three days of meetings in Vienna this week. But Russia is pushing back -- even though fears about the coronavirus have sent oil prices crashing into yet another bear market. ",
            "The Russians said \"they need more time\" to weigh recommendations from the group's technical committee and assess the impact of the coronavirus on the market, a source close to the negotiations told CNN Business' John Defterios. ",
            "The coronavirus has clobbered oil prices because it is destroying demand in China, the world's largest oil importer and the epicenter of global oil demand growth. The crisis has killed more than 560 people, infected over 28,000 and brought large parts of the world's second-largest economy to a standstill.  ",
            "The compromise proposal from Saudi Arabia was to cut oil production by 600,000 barrels per day, down from 800,000 to 1 million barrels, a senior OPEC source confirmed to CNN. ",
            "The apparent conflict between OPEC and Russia dashes hopes that the group will be able to arrest the sharp decline in prices. ",
            "\"The coronavirus has completely taken the oil market hostage,\" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \"The market is watching what OPEC does with bated breath. If OPEC is not able to stick the landing, it will have a big psychological hit to the market.\" ",
            "US oil prices retreated to around $50.70 a barrel on the news. Crude had climbed as high as $52.20 on Thursday on hopes of a strong OPEC response. S&P Global Platts Analytics said earlier this week it was reasonable to expect a 1 million barrel per day production cut by OPEC.  ",
            "Earlier this week, oil plunged into a bear market, signifying a 20% decline from previous highs. Crude closed at a 13-month low of $49.61 on Tuesday.  ",
            "Oil demand in 'free fall'",
            "Unlike recent oil tailspins, this one has been triggered by demand destruction, not excess supply. And demand shocks can be more challenging to stop because of the uncertainty involved. ",
            "\"What we're facing now is a different beast. Demand is just in free fall,\" said Tran.  ",
            "In a best-case scenario, oil demand will tumble by 1.5 million barrels per day in February, according to Platts. The worst-case scenario by the firm calls for demand to plunge by 4 million barrels per day.  ",
            "Most concerning for oil bulls, the appetite for jet fuel has cratered because major airlines including American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and British Airways have suspended all flights to and from mainland China.  ",
            "Daily flight cancellations are approaching nearly 3,000, according to RBC, which is using artificial intelligence to track real-time flight patterns. China's Sinopec has slashed its overall crude throughput by about 13% and its refineries are operating in China at minimum run rates, according to Platts.  ",
            "\"This is, in our opinion, the most acute threat to global demand since the financial crisis of 2008,\" said Tran.  ",
            "Will Saudi Arabia act alone?",
            "Demand for oil has been relatively resilient in the years since the Great Recession, boosted by the rapid economic growth in China and India. Previous demand shocks include the Sept. 11 terror attacks and the SARS infection of 2003. ",
            "It's unclear what OPEC will do next.  ",
            "Under new Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, the kingdom has signaled it would prefer not to act alone anymore. Saudi Arabia would prefer that other major oil players, including Russia, help shoulder the burden of production cuts.  ",
            "OPEC must now decide if wishes to act alone, without the support of Russia. Such a move could jeopardize the OPEC+ alliance that has worked well in recent years to put a floor beneath weak oil prices.  ",

            " (CNN)The term \"cruise ship\" evokes images of luxury and well-being, but that is far from what a dream vacation has become for thousands of passengers now trapped on several cruise ships by the sudden emergence of the Wuhan coronavirus.",
            "We've been hearing from passengers, but the most recent cry for help comes from crew members of the Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama, Japan, with passengers and crew trapped -- without any semblance of luxury or comfort --- in what is probably history's largest floating quarantine vessel. Some 3,700 people aboard remain forcibly quartered; at least 135 passengers have tested positive for the virus. ",
            "Crew members, forced to continue working, are pleading. \"We are extremely scared,\" said Binay Kumar Sakar in a video obtained by CNN. That was before this ship became part prison, part hospital, part Twilight Zone luxury resort. Employees say the requirement that they work, interacting with potentially infected passengers, leaves them utterly unprotected; several workers have already become infected. CNN has reached out to Princess Cruises for comment. Their fear is particularly resonant across an industry which, as a whole, has long been known for in the past exploiting some of its workers.",
            "Among the passengers, some say they are tolerating the confinement fairly well, but it's hard to imagine what enduring this experience is like for people in the less luxurious interior cabins. A ship's \"state rooms,\" as they are called, tend to be small. The ones without a view of the sea and with more limited space must be a nightmare of claustrophobia.",
            "Is this the best way to deal with a viral outbreak?",
            "The highly contagious virus is a minefield of ethical, political and moral dilemmas. That it emerged in China, a country ruled by an authoritarian, politically-repressive regime, wrapped the crisis in a uniquely chilling atmosphere. ",
            "Governments, public health experts and private firms are trying to figure out how to respond to the crisis; much of the response appears improvised. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said that the virus presents a \"grave threat\" to the world and \"one clinical trial is already on the way\" in China in an attempt to find a cure; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offered experts Tuesday to help study the virus in China. But many aboard cruise ships remain in limbo. ",
            "The complaints of the Diamond Princess crew point to the risks of the current lockdown approach aboard these ships. Crew members are not trained as health care workers. Passenger ships are not meant to be quarantine areas. They are not designed or equipped for this purpose. Their employees did not sign up for this type of work. Passengers should be permitted to disembark and safely move to a different facility, on firm ground, where they can be tested; where the necessary supplies are on hand; where the staff is doing the work for which they were trained. ",
            "This virus has unsurprisingly created a multitude of tough decisions.",
            "From the moment we learned that a new virus was causing thousands of people in China to become ill, it became apparent that this would be more than a simple illness of concern only to health experts and residents of the most affected areas. This virus is much more, for many more.",
            "China's decision to put nearly 60 million people under lockdown in and around Wuhan is unprecedented and highly controversial. When a local doctor, Li Wenliang, tried to raise the alarm in December, authorities detained him and accused him of spreading rumors. He died of the virus last week. Then a citizen journalist, Chen Qiushi, providing critical reporting from Wuhan, suddenly disappeared. Another citizen journalist was reportedly arrested on Monday amid reports of a growing number of arrests for criticism of the government's handling of the crisis.",
            "But it's not just China's response that has raised questions. Whenever a contagion becomes so serious that the word \"quarantine\" becomes part of the discussions, the ethical cost of such prevention casts a shadow on every decision.",
            "Quarantine is a frontal assault on freedom. It literally deprives individuals of their liberties for the sake of the larger community, raising countless difficult questions.",
            "How much power should authorities have over the daily lives of individuals? How much should individuals sacrifice for the sake of the community? How far should the state go in enforcing restrictions? Should people go to jail for violating a confinement to which they are forced because of no fault of their own?  What to do when someone becomes ill on a ship holding thousands of healthy passengers? If you decide to keep the passengers on board, who will bring their food? How will they be protected?",
            "The cruise industry is undoubtedly taking a financial hit with vessels in the news and passengers who were supposed to be enjoying a trip of a lifetime enduring prolonged confinement. ",
            "As a result, some companies are responding with measures that appear driven more by prejudice than prevention. Royal Caribbean has announced that it will -- reasonably -- deny boarding to anyone who traveled through China in the past two weeks. Less reasonably, it was for a time barring any holder of passports from China, Hong Kong or Macau, regardless of whether they had set foot in those locations. ",
            "The virus, and the intensive media attention it is receiving, have spurred an outbreak of fear and prejudice and, quite predictably, an avalanche of bigotry in many countries, and a torrent of conspiracy theories, including from government officials who should know better.",
            "The knee jerk reaction is to lock away anyone who might have become infected and push away anyone perceived, however unfairly, to pose a risk.",
            "The problem of prejudice is so severe that two months into the crisis public health authorities had not been able to come up with a name for the virus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses is struggling with the challenge. To prevent the stigma, the naming committee wants to avoid a name that includes a geographical location, a culture, industry, name, animal or food. Without an officially recognized name, many call it the Wuhan virus, while authorities temporarily went with Novel Coronavirus or NcV-2019. Finally on Tuesday, with more than 42,000 cases diagnosed, the WHO named it \"COVID-19.\" ",
            "It is a virus that is having an impact that goes beyond public health. It will not only reverberate across the global economic and political landscape, but it is already the source of moral and ethical questions.  ",
            "Warehousing passengers and crew on a ship is not a responsible solution. Workers who did not sign up for quarantine duty should be let off the ship, moved along with the rest of those on board to a more suitable facility.",

            "The virus has also spread globally to more than 17 countries. On Tuesday, experts from the German Robert-Koch-Institute said they believed that a man who tested positive for coronavirus in Germany is the first case of human-to-human infection in Europe.  ",
            "Carrie Lam, Hong Kong chief executive, told a news conference that the closure of crossings into the semi-autonomous Chinese city would be \"temporary.\" Lam added that the city was also slashing the number of tourist visas it issues to visitors from mainland China, and halving the number of inbound flights from the mainland. ",
            "Authorities in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak, earlier said an additional 1,300 cases had been confirmed, bringing the total in the region to over 2,700. The majority of those are still in hospital, with more than 125 in critical condition. Between Sunday and Monday, there was a 65% jump in the number of reported cases in mainland China, from around 2,700 to over 4,500. ",
            "Elsewhere in China, cases have been confirmed in every province and territory except for Tibet, which this week announced the indefinite closure of all tourist attractions and a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travelers entering the region. ",
            "The move to close off Hong Kong comes after intense pressure from lawmakers and medical unions, one of which had threatened to strike if the border was not shut. ",
            "On Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a level 3 alert warning against \"all nonessential travel to China\" -- its highest alert on a scale of 1 to 3.",
            "\"There is an ongoing outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that can be spread from person to person,\" the CDC said in a statement, warning \"there is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.\" ",
            "Worldwide concern ",
            "More than a dozen countries around the world have confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus, as authorities struggle to stop its spread. ",
            "Across Asia, numerous countries have put in extra screening at airports and warned citizens to avoid travel to China. To China's north, neighboring Mongolia has imposed stringent border checks on travelers coming into the country, while Hong Kong earlier banned all visitors from Wuhan.",
            "Indonesia and the Philippines have both introduced extra restrictions on Chinese tourists, while Japan has upgraded its response, allowing authorities to \"force the suspicious cases for hospitalization and testing.\" ",

With a great sense of responsibility, China is sparing no effort in curbing the spread of disease and saving lives. Now is a crucial moment, and China has full capability and confidence in winning the battle against the epidemic.\"",
            "Some 60 million people have been placed under travel restrictions in Hubei, with almost all movement in and out of Wuhan itself stopped and much of the city on lockdown. ",
            "Officials have also cracked down on the trade of wild animals, after the Wuhan coronavirus was linked to a seafood market selling exotic live mammals, including bats and civet cats, which have previously been linked to the 2003 SARS outbreak. ",

            "The first cases of the coronavirus were detected in Wuhan in mid-December. Since then the number of confirmed cases has increased a thousandfold, and infections have been reported worldwide. ",
            "Hospitals in Wuhan are already massively overstretched, and hundreds of emergency medical personnel have been dispatched to the city to help. Two new hospitals are also being built on the city's outskirts, due to be operational by next week. ",
            "Wuhan and Hubei officials have faced criticism for apparently downplaying the danger of the virus in the early weeks of the outbreak. There was a marked shift in the handling of the crisis once the national government got involved on January 22. ",
            "Despite the colossal effort -- and potential social and economic cost -- of effectively quarantining Hubei, it appears that this has come too late to stop the virus' spread. By the time Wuhan introduced even basic screening of travelers leaving the city, the virus had been reported in Japan, Thailand and South Korea, and spread to most of the rest of China. ",
            "Part of the problem is that the virus can apparently be spread before symptoms appear, according to China's health minister, Ma Xiaowei. ",

            "While the current outbreak does not appear to be as deadly as SARS, which killed over 700 people worldwide, it may be spreading more rapidly. That could be due to being more contagious, or the increased interconnectedness of both China and the world than in 2003. ",
            "As of mid-March 2003, roughly a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to SARS by Chinese authorities, and three months after the first cases were detected in China, the number of confirmed cases worldwide stood at around 3,200, with 159 confirmed deaths. ",
            "Growing fears in Hong Kong",
            "Fears of the virus' spread have led to calls for increased action in multiple countries and territories, not least in Hong Kong, where memories of SARS still run deep. ",
            "Effective midnight on Thursday until further notice, Lam said Hong Kong's measures also include decreasing the number of inbound buses from the mainland, and the suspension of cross-border coach services at the Hong Kong-Zuhai-Macau Bridge. All cross-border ferry services will also be suspended.",
            "Operations at Hong Kong's West Kowloon Train Station -- which operates high speed rail services to the mainland -- will shut. Passenger services will also be temporarily suspended at the border crossings of Hung Hom, Sha Tau Kok, and Man Kam To. ",
            "In addition to the closing many of its borders with China, the city's government announced that government workers would be encouraged to work from home when the Lunar New Year holiday ends on Wednesday. The directive, which excluded emergency service workers and people who work for essential public services, urged the private sector to enforce similar arrangements.",
            "The sweeping moves follow calls from one of the city's leading health experts for \"substantial draconian measures\" to limit population mobility in order to rein in the virus. Speaking at a news conference Monday, Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong, warned that the number of cases could potentially double every six days in the absence of decisive government action. ",
            "\"This epidemic is growing at quite a fast rate and it's accelerating,\" said Leung, who is also the founding director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Infection Disease Epidemiology and Control in Hong Kong. He predicted the actual number of cases -- including those who are incubating the virus but not yet showing symptoms -- could be 10 times what has been reported. ",
            "Leung's team modeled two scenarios -- one with a population quarantine as has been seen in Wuhan and one without -- but found more or less identical results, because the virus has already spread to other major population centers in China, which could soon see their own self-sustaining epidemics. ",
            "Leung said the findings had concerned the team enough that it felt the need to alert the authorities and the public, predicting a peak of cases between April and May. ",

            "\"I think that's a problem that's going to go away,\" Trump said during a trip to India, expressing confidence that the epidemic will not seriously harm the global economy.",
            "But behind the scenes the President is less calm, and he is expressing frustration at some of the ways his administration is responding to the outbreak, sources familiar with the conversations told CNN. His mood reflects a growing realization among Trump's staff that the coronavirus is going to pose a greater challenge than previously understood.",
            "After weeks of telling Americans that China has a lid on the situation, the President will return from India amid growing concern in Washington over the virus and partisan criticism of his attitude.",
            "A panicked 1,000-point Wall Street sell-off, a building world supply-chain crunch and a looming hit to global growth together could pose peril for Trump by slowing the strong economy he plans to ride to reelection. ",
            "But even more worryingly, the virus is spreading to Europe and the Middle East in a way that has experts warning it could soon become a full-blown pandemic. In such a scenario, the US could not expect to escape from a wave of infections and Trump would face a test of his leadership and capacity to bring a jumpy nation together.",
            "Trump acknowledged Monday's Wall Street plunge, but noted futures were higher ahead of Tuesday's market open in the United States and he said that his administration was putting \"a lot of talent, brainpower\" behind tackling the virus.",
            "The President ticked though administration efforts to contain the virus, claiming the US had \"essentially closed the borders.\"",

            "Apple, for instance, said last week that the outbreak was hurting its business more than it had previously expected and was hampering its manufacturing and sales in China.",
            "Manufacturers in technology, transport and other sectors in the United States and across the world are reliant on supply chains fanning out from China, and a lengthy disruption could pose problems for sustained economic growth.",
            "Since China represents such a large slice of the global economy, any slowdown sparked by efforts to contain the virus could have long-term effects everywhere, even if health experts manage to hold off a pandemic.",
            "Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, warned: \"The coronavirus might be slowing in mainland China, but the huge jump over the weekend to various other countries has many reassessing 2020 growth estimates.\"",
            "\"The International Monetary Fund already lowered China's growth this year, but should the virus continue to spread to other parts of the world, we could see quickly decreasing earnings and growth outlooks,\" Detrick said in a statement.",

            " (CNN)As the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread beyond China, federal public health officials in the US are taking a rare step: issuing a mandatory quarantine -- the first one in more than 50 years.",
            "\"The goal here is to slow the entry of this virus into the United States,\" says Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ",
            "Here's what a federal quarantine could look like.",
            "What does it mean to be in federal quarantine?",
            "What federal quarantine entails exactly can depend on the circumstances, said James Hodge, director at the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University.",
            "Generally, individuals facing a mandatory quarantine are under a direct order from federal authorities to stay in the same place for a brief period of time while medical professionals assess whether they have been infected with a particular disease.",
            "In this latest case, people are being ordered to stay in facilities designated by the federal government, although in other potential situations, they could be confined to a hospital or their own homes, Hodge told CNN.",
            "Who's being quarantined? ",
            "Americans who have either been in China's Hubei province within the last 14 days or have traveled to other parts of mainland China and are showing symptoms associated with the virus will be screened at one of 11 designated US airports and subject to a mandatory quarantine at a nearby facility, the US Department of Homeland Security has announced.",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also quarantining Americans who have been evacuated by the State Department from Wuhan, the agency said. ",
            "\"This strategy is not meant to catch every single traveler returning from China with novel coronavirus. Given the nature of this virus and how it's spreading, that would be impossible. But working together we can catch the majority of them,\" Messonnier said in a call to reporters Monday.",
            "Where are people in quarantine staying?",
            "The CDC said it is working with state and local partners to identify locations where eligible travelers coming in through the 11 designated US airports could potentially be quarantined. Those could include military bases, hotels or other sites, Messonnier said.",
            "Others evacuated from Wuhan by the State Department are staying in military housing, the CDC said.",
            "Two charter flights carrying US citizens from Wuhan landed Wednesday at Travis Air Force Base in California. One will remain there, while the other is expected to continue on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, a US official with knowledge of the matter told CNN.",
            "Later this week, two more flights are due to land in the United States, the CDC said. One will arrive at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and the other is due at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska.",
            "In addition to those places, the Pentagon has announced that the 168th Regiment, Regional Training Institute in Colorado could also be used to quarantine people.",
            "Last week, another US government-arranged flight arrived from Wuhan at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, California, where 195 Americans remain under quarantine.",
            "But Hodge said he's concerned that the federal government will run out of capacity to house people in quarantine fast.",
            "\"They only have room for 1,000 persons,\" he said. \"That's four flights.\"",
            "The CDC said it expects both the number of travelers arriving to the US from Wuhan and Hubei province and the number of people who meet the criteria for federal quarantine to decrease.",
            "What's life like in a federal quarantine?",
            "While a federal quarantine doesn't exactly resemble a four-star hotel, people are entitled to food, water, accommodations and medical treatment, and are free to communicate with family and friends, Hodge said. But they can't leave their specified location until federal authorities say so.",
            "A group of 195 Americans, many of them diplomats and their families, arrived by plane last week at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, California. They have been put under a mandatory 14-day quarantine from the time they left Wuhan.",
            "According to Jarred Evans, one of the Americans under quarantine at the base, everyone there is in good spirits. ",
            "CDC medical staff checks on the people at the base twice a day, taking their temperature and asking about their symptoms, he said. To his knowledge, no one has developed symptoms so far. ",
            "To pass the time, the evacuees have access to Zumba and kickboxing classes, and children have toys and organized activities, he said. And as for the food, meals have included eggs, potatoes, muffins, sandwiches and chips.",
            "\"Everyone is respecting one another,\" Evans told CNN. \"No group hugs or shaking hands though.\"",
            "Is the federal government allowed to do this?",
            "Yes, although some epidemiologists, lawyers and health organizations have expressed concerns that the CDC's broad authority could pose a threat to civil liberties.",
            "The Department of Health and Human Services, which the CDC falls under, has the authority to isolate or quarantine people in order to prevent communicable diseases from being transmitted or spread either from a foreign country into the US or from state to state.",
            "The government can only isolate or quarantine people who the CDC \"reasonably believes\" may be infected with or exposed to a quarantinable disease, which includes smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers and severe acute respiratory syndromes.",
            "Before issuing a quarantine or isolation order, the CDC conducts a public health risk assessment that considers a person's symptoms and whether they could have been exposed to the disease.",
            "The CDC has three days from the time they take a person into custody to serve them with an order for quarantine, isolation or conditional release.",
            "The CDC says it strives to use the \"least restrictive and time-consuming measures\" to protect public health. But keeping someone at a military base in California is considerably more restrictive than home quarantine, Hodge said.",
            "\"The CDC is clearly concerned, as we are globally, about any spread of this condition anywhere in the United States, and to be sure, that's a legitimate concern,\" Hodge said. \"But is it any different than what we've seen with prior infectious disease situations including Ebola and other fronts where we did allow for home quarantine under those circumstances? Most likely not.\"",
            "But it's possible that the CDC has information about the people in quarantine that they haven't released publicly, which could potentially justify the agency's case for this kind of quarantine, he added.",
            "CNN has reached out to the CDC about these questions but has not yet received a response.",
            "How long can someone be quarantined?",
            "The government can quarantine someone \"only as long as necessary to protect the public,\" according to regulations issued by DHS in 2017.",
            "In that time, the government would provide the public with health care options to protect against the disease, such as voluntary immunization or drug treatment, and ensure that quarantined people who have been exposed to the disease don't infect others. ",
            "Right now, there is no vaccine to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus. Experts say the best way to prevent infection is to avoid exposure to the virus.",
            "While the novel coronavirus has killed more than 400 people in mainland China, US officials say that the overall risk to the American public is low.",
            "There are currently 11 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the US -- nine of those people had recently traveled to Wuhan. The other two remaining cases had sustained contact in close quarters with people who traveled to Wuhan. ",
            "What rights do people in quarantine have?",
            "People who are in quarantine are entitled to a written order from the CDC within 72 hours of being apprehended that explains why the agency thinks quarantine is necessary.",
            "If a person in quarantine believes the CDC has made a mistake, they can request that the agency reassess its written order within 72 hours. If the CDC maintains that quarantine is necessary, the person can request an independent medical review to determine whether the CDC's recommendation is appropriate. They can also hire representation to be present at the medical review at their own expense. ",
            "Those who can't afford to hire their own representation can have a representative appointed at the government's expense.",
            "People in quarantine also have the right to take their concerns to court.",
            "Who foots the bill for this?",
            "If a person has health insurance, the CDC will bill their insurance provider for costs of care delivered during quarantine, according to Hodge. So depending on their insurance coverage, a person could be responsible for some or all of those costs.",
            "During the public comment period for HHS' latest rule on quarantine regulations, which went into effect in 2017, a flight attendant union argued that the federal government should pay for any medical costs incurred by flight attendants in quarantine. But HHS rejected the suggestion.",
            "\"... While it is not HHS/CDC's intent to unduly burden individuals with the costs of their own isolation or quarantine, payment for expenses will be made consistent with constitutional and ethical obligations to provide for the basic necessities, e.g., food, medical treatment, for those subject to such public health orders,\" the department said in its final rule.",
            "For those who are deemed unable to afford health insurance, the government will pick up the tab but Hodge said it might outsource some of those costs to programs like Medicaid when possible.",
            "Evans told CNN that the evacuees at March Air Reserve Base will be billed for their evacuation flight. He doesn't know what other evacuees are being charged, but he said that his own bill is for $1,100. And once the quarantine is up, he said everyone will have to pay their own way to their final destination. ",
            "What happens if someone violates the quarantine?",
            "If someone decides to walk out and violate evade quarantine orders, there will be consequences.",
            "Federal law states that a person who violates quarantine orders are subject to a fine of up to $100,000, a year in jail or both, if the violation doesn't result in a death. If it does result in a death, the person would be subject to a fine of up to $250,000, a year in jail or both.",
            "When was the last time a federal quarantine happened?",
            "Before concerns about the novel coronavirus, the last time US officials issued a federal quarantine order was in the 1960s for smallpox evaluation, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told reporters Friday.",
            "The CDC defines quarantine as separating and restricting the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they get sick.",
            "It's more common for the agency to issue federal isolation orders, which separate people who have been infected with a contagious disease from those who have not been infected. The CDC said it issues about one to two orders for quarantine, isolation or conditional release a year.",
            "Are quarantines effective? ",
            "In general, confining people who have or could be suspected to have a disease like coronavirus to one place is effective to prevent it from being transmitted to others, Hodge said.",
            "But how quarantine orders are executed make a big difference, he said. Compelling people to stay in a facility away from their home for period as long as two weeks could have unintended consequences. People could potentially lie about or misrepresent their degree of exposure to a disease to avoid that kind of situation, Hodge said.",
            "\"The potential implementation of federal, heavy-handed quarantine can be problematic and can backfire,\" he said.",
            "Allowing people to be contained within their own homes would be a better solution, Hodge said, and would make people more willing to comply.",
            "But CDC officials said on Friday that once people are educated on why the federal government believes quarantine is necessary, they mostly cooperate.",
            "\"We understand that this is a difficult situation for them. They've been through an ordeal,\" Messonnier said. \"And we're asking them to take the time with us to make sure that they're protecting their families and their communities, and we really admire their flexibility and resilience.\"",

            "Health authorities in Hubei announced an additional 242 deaths and 14,840 cases of the virus, known officially as Covid-19, as of Thursday morning, the largest single-day rise since the epidemic began and almost 10 times the number of cases confirmed the previous day. ",
            "The government explained the spike as due to a change in how cases are tabulated -- the total will now include \"clinically diagnosed cases\" after rising numbers of residents complained about the difficulty in getting tested and treated for the virus. ",
            "\"Clinically diagnosed cases\" are those patients who demonstrate all the symptoms of Covid-19 but have been unable to be scientifically tested, or died before they were tested. The hope is that more people will be able to receive treatment by allowing doctors to diagnose them with the virus. ",
            "Almost 34,000 patients have been hospitalized across Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is capital, including 1,400 or so in a critical condition. So far, 3,441 patients have recovered and been discharged. ",
            "Globally, the virus has infected more than 60,000 people, with the vast majority of cases in mainland China. On Thursday, China said it has confirmed 59,804 cases on the mainland, an increase of 15,152 cases from the previous day.",

            "However, the major increase in the number of deaths and cases of the coronavirus appears to dash hopes that the outbreak was leveling off. It comes as additional cases were confirmed on the quarantined cruise ship docked in the Japanese city of Yokohama, and in the US, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned the country \"can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold.\" ",

While there have been efforts to speed up the process, scientific testing of samples is difficult and time consuming, and allowing doctors to diagnose patients will enable far more people to receive treatment, including in several purpose-built hospitals dedicated to treating the virus in Wuhan.

            "\"I don't trust the reporting in China, and I also believe that the China numbers reflect the most severe cases, so we're getting a skewed view of the case fatality rate and how severe this is,\" Gottlieb said. ",
            "Counting milder or asymptomatic cases could make the case fatality rate drop significantly, he added, but \"even a case fatality rate of .2 or .5 could be catastrophic if this is highly contagious and spreads around the world.\"",
            "Speaking at the same hearing, Asha George, executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, said that China may be limited in its testing and reporting resources, versus simply \"a lack of desire on the part of the Chinese government to report.\"",
            "In public health schools, George said students are taught to assume they don't have complete data and account for cases they don't yet know about. ",

For every one case you see, there are seven or eight out there that you don't,\" she explained. \"So that means actually we'd be looking at hundreds of thousands of cases.

            "\"No, because we're ready for it,\" Trump responded. \"It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it.\" ",
            "The President said that most of the Americans who have been diagnosed with the virus in the US are doing well. ",
            "\"Of the 15 people ... eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they're fully recovered. One is in the hospital. And five have fully recovered. And one we think is in pretty good shape,\" Trump said, but later added, \"One is pretty sick but hopefully will recover.\"",
            "The President returned from India to see his administration on the defensive over its handling of the coronavirus, as Cabinet officials were grilled in Congress and Democrats panned the White House's budget request to fight the virus.",
            "The stock market decline especially has exacerbated Trump's rising concerns over how to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus even as he has publicly declared the virus to be \"very much under control in the USA,\" multiple people tell CNN. ",
            "But investors are growing concerned about the economic impact of the virus, as is the President, whose reelection campaign is banking on a strong economy. ",
            "The President suggested at the news conference on Wednesday that Tuesday night's Democratic debate in South Carolina was part of the cause of the stock market decline -- even though it took place after the market's dip.",
            "\"I think you can add quite a bit of sell-off to what they're saying,\" Trump said. \"I really believe that's a factor.\"",
            "Trump has been publicly downplaying the novel coronavirus' effects, because he thinks doing otherwise could cause further panic in the markets -- and he's been frustrated with officials issuing warnings about the unknowns of the virus's spread. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is one aide who encouraged Trump to downplay the latest developments, at least publicly, one person says. ",
            "Unhappy with administration's response",
            "The appointment of Pence came after the White House denied it was considering appointing a czar to oversee the administration's response outbreak.",

            "\"Mike will be working with the professionals, doctors and everybody else that is working. The team is brilliant. I spent a lot of time with the team the last couple weeks,\" the President said. \"But they are brilliant and we're doing really well and Mike is going to be in charge and Mike will report back to me. But he has a certain talent for this.\"",
            "According to administration sources, Trump has been displeased with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar -- for failing to keep him updated on crucial decisions concerning the virus.",
            "Lawmakers have also called on Trump to appoint someone to oversee the response, which came up during a clash over the administration's request for more coronavirus funding. Some White House officials accused HHS of requesting disproportionate amounts of money to cover up what one official described as Azar's \"mismanagement.\"",
            "Standing beside Trump and Pence at the end of the news conference, Azar asserted that he's still the chairman of the coronavirus task force and added that he was \"delighted\" to learn the vice president would be leading the administration on the issue. ",
            "Travel restrictions under consideration",
            "Earlier this month, the US began implementing travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had visited China and US citizens who have been near the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China's Hubei province. Before Trump announced the China restrictions, there was a debate inside the White House about the logistics of applying such a ban. ",
            "And behind the scenes, Trump is pushing for more travel restrictions on countries the virus is spreading to, administration officials tell CNN, but so far no decisions have been made. ",
            "Administration officials have been privately weighing imposing additional travel bans, a senior administration official and sources close to the White House said. ",
            "The administration increased the travel advisory warning for Japan and South Korea earlier this week, so those two countries would be likely targets for increased travel restrictions.",

            "Washington (CNN)The US aviation industry and the Trump administration are in a pitched battle over the response to the coronavirus pandemic, three sources familiar with recent calls between officials from several government agencies and US airlines have told CNN.",
            "In a series of contentious conversations, agency officials and aviation executives have clashed over the administration's demand that airlines collect new kinds of data from passengers to help officials track potential virus carriers. ",
            "Airlines say they can't meet that demand right away -- a claim some administration officials say they don't believe, according to several sources who tell CNN the calls have deteriorated so badly that agency officials have issued threats, spat expletives and accused airline executives of lying. It is an \"epic battle,\" said one source familiar with the talks. ",
            "On one call, an administration official pointed to potential fines if the airlines didn't comply, according to two sources. The Federal Register, where proposed rules are published, laid out the new requirements for added data collection and listed penalties that include fines as high as $500,000 as well as jail time of up to a year. ",
            "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have even threatened recommending that the administration try to ground planes in the US if they can't get the passenger data, according to one source.",
            "'Shock and disbelief'",
            "The administration officials' vitriol has left airline officials in a state of \"shock and disbelief,\" one source said. Government officials have displayed \"a lot of ignorance about what is possible,\" the source said. Others familiar with the talks contend the airlines seem to be acting unreasonably by not providing the data more quickly.   ",
            "Another factor adding to the friction is that the administration is considering an advisory discouraging Americans from commercial air travel. Airlines oppose this because of the body blow it would deal their industry, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.  ",
            "The battle over data is raging as the administration is coming under fire for failing to move quickly or competently enough to protect Americans from a virus that has already killed thousands worldwide and is beginning to hit the US, with more than 500 people infected and 22 dead. ",
            "The anger and recrimination are fueled by the fact that for both the White House and the airlines, CoVID19 -- the coronavirus that has infected about 108,000 people worldwide and killed around 3,500 in 93 countries -- poses a profound threat. ",
            "The international aviation industry could face losses north of $100 billion if the virus isn't contained soon, with revenues and ridership already plummeting. ",
            "In the White House, President Donald Trump has seen stock markets sink, a development that could undermine a central plank of his re-election campaign: that his presidency has delivered a thriving economy. ",
            "On Friday, the White House signaled it could offer an olive branch and take steps to ease the financial strain on US airlines by deferring taxes. Airlines, concerned about complicated privacy issues the data collection may pose, have tried to meet the administration halfway, proposing to develop an app and website for data collection. ",
            "For now, though, tensions remain high as the two sides remain far apart as both struggle to deal with the pandemic and the airlines brace for the fees and other punitive measures the White House might implement starting March 14. ",
            "\"If the focus is doing it exactly the way the administration wants, it will be a long negotiation,\" said Washington Rep. Rick Larsen, the Democratic chair of the House aviation subcommittee. The \"airlines don't have all the information the CDC wants,\" Larsen said.",
            "The standoff over data goes back years, said one source, who added that the CDC seems to be using the coronavirus outbreak to force airlines to agree to its demands. The broader debate is about what role airlines should play in determining if their passengers have been exposed to the disease.",
            "This newest surge of friction began a few weeks ago, after the Presidential proclamation in late January that essentially banned any foreign national from entering the US if they had been to China within the previous two weeks. ",
            "In a series of calls, the administration told airlines they had to comply with a directive to ask travelers if they had been to China within the past 48 hours. CDC had initially wanted passengers to answer 22 fields of information but narrowed that to five questions about passengers' contact info. They are particularly interested in recent visitors to China, Italy and South Korea.",
            "Aviation executives said they don't have the technology to do that digitally, explaining it would take six months to make the necessary technical fixes. They could, however, use paper, they said. An official from the Centers for Disease Control accused the airlines of lying, according to two of the sources, and of not stepping up to the plate, leaving the industry executives reeling in shock.",
            "The blowups between administration officials and the airlines have continued, occurring more recently over the requirement that airlines collect more passenger and crew data than they normally would, including email addresses, phone numbers and addresses to help track potential coronavirus carriers. ",
            "The demand is a difficult one for airlines for technical reasons as well as privacy issues, particularly in Europe. ",
            "But during conversations about the new data requirements, CDC officials made a point of telling the airlines about $250,000 fines they would have to pay if they do not start complying by mid-March. The Federal Register listing that sets out the new requirements also notes that penalties could include criminal charges and up to a year in jail.  ",
            "Heated calls",
            "Individual airlines often had security or IT officials on the calls to explain technical issues as needed, but the calls got so heated at times that airline representatives themselves piped up. ",
            "\"There were several calls between the airlines and the US government about this new data collection process, which was initiated in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak,\" said a CDC spokesperson. \"We understand that any new process can be challenging to implement quickly, which is why the rule is currently open for public comment. Airlines have been encouraged to provide feedback through that public comment process.\"",
            "The calls between airline executives and the agencies are set to pick up before the March 14th deadline, though no date has been set. ",
            "Airlines for America told CNN that the airlines \"appreciate the collaborative dialogue with the US government to further our shared goal of protecting the safety and well-being of all travelers, which is -- and will always be -- the top priority of US carriers. We look forward to continuing to coordinate and work collaboratively with the top leaders in the Administration and across federal agencies to assess the best next steps.\"",
            "Before the coronavirus outbreak, airlines were expected to share information they had in their records. The new change means they must collect the information the administration seeks. One airline official told CNN they now feel under the gun to compile the data because the administration could ask for it at any point. ",
            "Another industry official familiar with the calls said, \"what may seem simple in a world of apps and other things in which it seems like everyone has information about you, it is not simple.\"",
            "This industry official says it took the US aviation industry two years to meet post-9/11 requirements, which also involved data collection. ",
            "Airlines are concerned that the Federal Register gives no clear end date on the data collection and worry that the US government could continue forcing them to collect it \"for other purposes.\"  ",
            "\"It seems they want us to do this for forever and we are pushing back,\" the first source familiar said. The airlines -- particularly their lawyers -- are worried about what Customs and Border Protection officials will do with the information. ",
            "They are also concerned about lawsuits from other countries, particularly given European Union privacy restrictions. \"The industry isn't interested in creating a system that would get them in trouble with EU privacy rules,\" the industry official said, adding that's been a problem for airlines before.",
            "Better ways to trace passengers",
            "Airlines asked the agency officials if the government would back them in the event of lawsuits and were told the administration would offer no support, according to the first source familiar. This source added that one US official told aviation executives their privacy concerns were \"bullshit\" because no country would push back on the collection of information given the threat CoVID19 poses.",
            "The White House was aware of the rising tensions on these calls when it invited aviation CEOs to meet with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday last week in an attempt to resolve the data sharing issues, according to third person familiar with events. ",
            "The White House meeting itself was not contentious, according to people familiar with it. ",
            "Airlines for America offered Trump a counter proposal for collecting data, telling him about an app and a website they are developing that would help the CDC get information more quickly, the group's president said after the meeting.",
            "Nicholas Calio, the president and CEO of Airlines for America, said the association felt there were \"better ways to trace the passengers coming in\" from places with high rates of the coronavirus.",
            "\"We've contracted to have a mobile app and a website developed that everybody would have to fill in that would go directly to the CDC with that information and we're moving forward with that,\" he said.",
            "The airline executives also used the opportunity to ask Trump and other White House officials not to publicly discourage Americans from taking flights, saying their businesses would be at risk if the government begins warning against commercial air travel. ",
            "Airlines are already reeling, canceling planned routes due to declining demand and projecting steep losses, with the International Air Transport Association saying the outbreak could cost the industry as much as $113 billion worldwide. ",
            "Despite the potential economic blow, Trump dismissed the idea of a bailout after the meeting last week. \"Don't ask that question please, because they haven't asked [for] that,\" Trump told a reporter. \"I don't want you to give them any ideas.\"",
            "But White House officials are considering deferring taxes for industries hurt by the coronavirus, including aviation, two people briefed on the discussions said. ",
            "White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday the \"measures that would be targeted toward individuals or small businesses or perhaps some industrial sectors. That's on the table... we are in the discussion and planning phase.\" ",

In these events, a procedure such as bronchoscopy -- where a doctor inserts a tube into the patient's lungs -- can result in many infections. ",

            "We must protect health care workers and others who care for sick people. This is done through a hierarchy of controls: source, engineering, administrative and personal.",
            "Source controls include encouraging patients who are only mildly ill to not expose others; requiring all people who are ill to wear face masks; limiting hospital attendance by visitors who may be infectious; ensuring that ill health care workers don't work; and minimizing the number -- and ensuring the safety of -- risky procedures such as bronchoscopy and sputum induction, by performing them only in isolation rooms.",
            "Engineering controls include putting partitions in triage areas, making sure potentially contaminated air is not recirculated and surfaces are cleaned meticulously, and implementing additional precautions for suspected cases.",
            "Administrative controls include asking all patients if they have symptoms and taking their temperatures; requiring those with cough or fever to wear a face mask, and isolating them from others at least by several feet until they are more thoroughly assessed. It's especially important to recognize all potentially infectious patients quickly and to implement strict infection control procedures and early in all areas of all health care facilities.",
            "Personal controls include hand washing and respiratory hygiene. But mask use by the general public -- people without symptoms who are not caring for others -- has little or no benefit and potentially great harm if people who need masks can't get them. Masks will be in short supply. The most important use is for health care workers and those caring for ill patients. In health care settings, safely reusable respiratory protection that can be disinfected can be crucially important. Useful products include personal air-purifying devices and elastomeric respirators. Patients also must be able to cover their mouths to reduce spread of infection.",
            "What more do we need to know?",
            "We are learning more, but unfortunately, the answer is, a lot.",

This is basic information. As just one example: How many children have been tested? Does the fact that there have been few infections in children reflect a lack of testing or a lack of infection?",

            "Small outbreaks continue to fast expand elsewhere, however, not least of which on board the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, where two deaths were confirmed Thursday, the first from the hundreds of cases on the ship, which has begun disembarking passengers after a 14-day quarantine this week. ",
            "The global death toll now stands at 2,129, after an additional 108 deaths were reported in Hubei province as of Thursday morning. All but 11 deaths have occurred in mainland China. On Thursday, South Korea reported its first death from the virus. ",
            "An additional 349 cases were confirmed in Hubei, more than 1,300 fewer than reported the day before. Outside of the provincial capital Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, the daily count of patients who have been treated and discharged has exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases for four consecutive days now, according to state news agency Xinhua. ",
            "There is some uncertainty of how cases are being diagnosed in Hubei, with the criteria for diagnosing the virus outside of the lab shifting in recent weeks. Chinese authorities this week switched back to reporting only laboratory confirmed cases from Hubei, after last week allowing clinical diagnoses by doctors -- based on symptoms or more immediate tests -- to be counted towards the province's totals. ",
            "More than 10,330 patients have been discharged across Hubei so far, though some 43,000 remain in hospital, 2,050 of whom are in a critical condition, the provincial health authority said. ",
            "The Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) previously estimated that the virus peaked in late January, according to data from lab tests. However, the number of clinically diagnosed cases -- patients with symptoms who could not be tested or were believed to have falsely tested negative -- continued to rise well into February. ",
            "While the data from the epicenter of the outbreak appears to be positive, the crisis may not be over yet, either inside China or worldwide. Experts have warned there could be a renewed increase in cases once China properly returns to work late this week or next -- hundreds of millions of people around the country have been on lockdown for weeks now. ",
            "The number of cases is also continuing to grow alarmingly in several places outside of the mainland, though still far short of the figures seen in China. On Thursday, South Korea recorded an additional 31 confirmed cases, bringing the country's total to 82. That came after an increase of 20 on Wednesday, previously the largest single-day jump in Korea. ",
            "In Singapore the infection rate continues to climb, with 84 confirmed cases. Similarly, in Hong Kong, there are 63 confirmed cases, and two deaths. ",
            "In Japan, where global attention has been focused on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, the worst outbreak outside of mainland China, there have been 68 cases confirmed with no connection to the ship, raising concerns of a self-sustaining outbreak in the country. ",

            "More passengers from the Diamond Princess disembarked Thursday morning, though serious questions remain over the effectiveness of the two-week quarantine imposed on the ship since it first docked at the Japanese port of Yokohama. ",
            "When the first load of passengers left the ship over the weekend, on a pair of flights to the US, more than a dozen of the 300 or so on board were found to be showing symptoms of the virus. All of those who had boarded the planes were supposedly coronavirus free, according to Japanese authorities. ",
            "The Japanese quarantine officially ended Wednesday, and the first group of passengers began disembarking. Hundreds of cases have been confirmed on board, however, and on Thursday authorities in Japan confirmed the first two deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. ",
            "Jan Swartz, President and CEO of the vessel's operator Princess Cruises, who had flown to Japan to greet the passengers as they left the ship, said that those on board united to help each through an \"unprecedented situation.\" ",
            "\"I think the guests and our crew who came together to help support each other, from 57 different countries and regions around the world, really lifted each other's hearts,\" Swartz said. ",
            "Multiple countries have arranged flights to bring their citizens home once they disembark -- so long as they do not test positive for the virus. Canada has chartered a plane from Tokyo's Haneda airport Friday. The 47 Canadians who had been found to have the virus would receive medical care in Japan, the government said in a statement. ",
            "The early evacuation of Americans from the ship was seen as something of an implicit criticism of the Japanese quarantine, with the Centers for Disease Control saying that remaining on the ship was an ongoing risk to US citizens. ",
            "Speaking to CNN this week, Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University who visited the ship, said he was highly concerned about the effectiveness of the quarantine and the precautions taken on board. ",
            "\"I was so scared because there was no way to tell where the virus is and everybody was not careful about it,\" Iwata said. \"There was no single infection control person inside the ship -- the bureaucrats were in charge of everything.\"",
            "Economic woes",
            "Japan is likely facing a recession as the coronavirus compounds existing problems with the country's economy. In China, while the worst of the virus is hopefully past, the economic cost has yet to be fully realized, and there are fears it could continue to grow and have knock-on ramifications for the global economy. ",
            "China's central bank promised more support Wednesday for companies, including lowering lending rates, increased credit support and providing medium and long-term loans. The People's Bank of China said the epidemic \"has had some impact on the Chinese economy, but the shock will be short-lived and will not change the country's sound economic fundamentals.\" ",
            "Other outlooks are not so rosy. Around a third of 1,000 small and medium-sized companies surveyed by academics from Tsinghua University and Peking University last week said they could only survive for a month with the cash they have.",
            "Smaller companies account for around 60% of China's GDP, and employ a massive 80% of all workers, according to government statistics published last September. ",
            "\"The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the camel's back,\" wrote Zhao Jian, director of the Shandong province-based Atlantis Research Institute in a research note earlier this month. ",
            "He warned that if the outbreak doesn't end soon, unemployment will likely rise as businesses shut down -- a problem Beijing had been fighting hard this year to prevent. Job losses could spur a tide of housing foreclosures, Zhao added, compounding the country's economic woes.",
            "Even as the country starts to get back to work, problems remain for smaller firms. According to the state-backed Global Times, Chinese factories and businesses trying to resume operations this week have been \"faced with tremendous risks and challenges, from lengthy applications to tough restrictions and shortages in cash, labor and supplies.\"",
            "Companies have reported having to submit up to 21 separate documents, including a 15-page application form, emergency plans and various other letters of commitment, to local officials. A screenshot of an application from a company in Sichuan province went viral on social media this week -- a single application to resume operation require a total of nine stamps from various county and provincial officials. ",
            "\"These are the unintended consequences of the battle against the epidemic: the restrictive measures put in place to stop the virus have also restricted companies from resuming production,\" Tian Yun, director of the China Society of Macroeconomics Research Center, told the Global Times. \"In some places, officials have taken the battle to a whole new, unnecessary level.\"",
