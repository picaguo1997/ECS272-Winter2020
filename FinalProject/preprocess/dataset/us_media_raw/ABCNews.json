            "\nCheri Preston reports for ABC News Radio\u2019s \"Perspective\" podcast: How worrying too much may make things worse.\n",
            "\nAs the number of people infected by coronavirus \u2013 also known as COVID-19 \u2013 continues to grow, so does the number of individuals concerned about the virus. But how much worry is too much?\n",
            "\nListen to the full interview with Cheri Preston and the rest of this past week's highlights here:",
            "\nDavid Ropeik, author of \u201cHow Risky Is It Really?\u201d and speaker on risk perception and communication, spoke to ABC\u2019s Cheri Preston, about the consequences of worrying too much.\n",
            "\n\u201cWhen a risk is new, it has uncertainty. We don't know yet what we need to know to protect ourselves, and that uncertainty makes us feel powerless, like we don't have control over it,\u201d Ropeik said. From canceled flights and events, sold out cleaning supplies, to drastically fluctuating stock markets, it\u2019s safe to say people are nervous. \u201cSo what we do is anything that gives us a sense of control, like we buy all the bottled water and toilet paper at Costco \u2026 but in part it's because we're freaking out rather than it's actually just good practice,\u201d Ropeik continued.",
            "\nFear of the unknown worries people just as much as the virus. While trying to take control of the situation -- whether that means self-quarantining, buying all the toilet paper at the supermarket or stocking up on canned goods -- can give people a sense of control, it\u2019s better to be cautious, aware and keep matters in perspective.\n",
            "\nRather than panic, it\u2019s suggested to do research on ways to prevent the virus from spreading more and what to watch out for by visiting the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) or World Health Organization\u2019 (WHO) website.\n",
            "\nABC\u2019s own Dr. Jen Ashton has also been answering hundreds of questions about COVID-19 for those who are looking for a better understanding of the virus, including what precautions to take.\n",
            "\n\u201cWe're in this fear state, but the fear state turns down the immune system. When you spread fear to your friends, it's almost like spreading germs to them. You wouldn't want people to do that to you. We shouldn't do that to other people,\u201d said Ropeik.\n",
            "\nSo, just like a smile or a yawn, fear can also be contagious and it's good to stay vigilant during these times.\n"

            "\nTrump's economic team joined in presenting the economic stimulus package privately to wary Senate Republicans, who have been cool to additional spending at this stage. Democrats are preparing their own package of low-cost virus testing, unemployment insurance and sick pay for workers struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces.",
            "\n\u201cWe're taking this unbelievably seriously,\" Trump said after his meeting at the Capitol. \u201cIt will go away, just stay calm.\u201d",
            "\nAsked why he has not yet been tested for the virus, after having been in close contact with several advisers and members of Congress who are now self-quarantined after exposure, Trump said: \u201cI don't think it's a big deal\u201d and \"I feel very good.\u201d ",
            "\nWhite House officials have been blindsided by the president's sudden moves. As Trump headed to Capitol Hill, two administration officials said the proposals he was putting in play had not been completed. They were unauthorized to discuss the planning and requested anonymity. ",
            "\nTrump's team offered few specifics at the closed door GOP lunch on the size of the payroll tax break or its duration, senators said. Trump has long promised to bring about an election year \"tax cuts 2.0,\" and seemed to be seizing on the virus fears as a way to bring about a victory on that front before November. ",
            "\nIn addition to payroll tax relief, Trump has said he wants help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they\u2019re \u201cnot going to miss a paycheck\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t get penalized for something that\u2019s not their fault.\" He's also mentioned small-business loans.",

Some Republicans endorsed Trump's suggestion that help be provided to the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries. Others spoke up to push for broader economic stimulus from a bipartisan highway bill they said was shovel-ready and popular. The payroll tax plan remains a work in progress.",

            "\nTrump had Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin meet with Pelosi, whose support will be needed for any deal in the divided Congress, where Republicans hold the Senate majority but Democrats hold the House. The two have successfully negotiated in the past and Mnuchin called the meeting productive.",

            "\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.",
            "\nAt the U.S. Capitol, some senators said they resisted shaking Trump's hand. Lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves, with the House's attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings. He recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead. ",
            "\nCrowds are the norm in the Capitol and handshakes are coin of the realm there, even between political foes. But about a half dozen lawmakers have placed themselves in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had the virus, and the norm has been upended.",
            "\nDuring House Democrats' closed session, one lawmaker, Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Ca., who is a doctor, noted that the average age in Congress is 57, some lawmakers have underlying health conditions and their work requires them to fly back and forth between home and the capital.",
            "\nStill, Pelosi implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country's defenses. Rather than picking up their own coffee and snacks for the breakfast meeting, lawmakers were served by staff from the buffet and warned off touching the serving utensils.",

Emphasizing the talks between Mnuchin and Pelosi, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that he and the speaker can pull this together.\"",

            "\nYet even within the administration, there are divisions on the best approach. The payroll-tax plan found support inside the administration from Jared Kushner and Peter Navarro, among others. Other Trump aides, such as Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, who was also on the Hill, advocated more modest measures.",

            "\nAt the Wednesday press conference, Trump made a rare appearance in the White House briefing room, taking questions for the first time and trying to portray a sense of calm amid rising fears over the virus, called COVID-19.",
            "\nBut some of his comments did not clear up some of the public's confusion.",
            "\nWhile health officials standing alongside him said cases would increase, Trump at times questioned whether that was true and downplayed the threat.\n",
            "\nA day earlier, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official had warned Americans of \"significant disruption\" coming because of the virus, hours after the president said the situation was \"under control\" and that it was a \"problem that's going to go away.\"\n",
            "\nOn Wednesday evening, Trump told reporters that \"there's a chance that it won't spread.\" In the same press conference, he noted that in California a 15th case of the virus had been confirmed.",
            "\nBut he did not mention what the CDC announced soon after the news conference concluded: that the patient had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual, making it possibly the first case of \"community spread\" on American soil.\n",
            "\nThe case raises questions about whether broader testing should be allowed. It appeared to indicate the virus had been circulating among the local community and infecting people, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected, according to the CDC.\n",
            "\nAzar had earlier referenced the case at a Wednesday afternoon congressional hearing -- saying its epidemiology was still being discerned -- but he did not provide any details or explain its potential implications.\n",
            "\nThe federal government has so far resisted wider testing, and Pence's office on Thursday morning did not respond to a question about whether that position had changed considering the California case.\n",
            "\nAt his Wednesday news conference, Trump even spread misinformation about the virus, incorrectly saying the mortality rate of influenza was higher than that of coronavirus.\n",
            "\nWhile the mortality rate of the coronavirus is not fully understood, this week the World Health Organization posted preliminary findings from within China, pegging the fatality rate of 2 to 4% in the hard-hit city of Wuhan and 0.7% elsewhere in the country. By comparison, the flu's mortality rate is about 0.1%.\n",
            "\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIAID), speaking next to Pence at the Thursday HHS photo op, also appeared to contradict the president, without mentioning his statement directly, providing an estimate of the coronavirus mortality rate.\n",
            "\n\"The death rate, or what we call the case fatality rate, is about 2%, 2.5%. Whether that's the most accurate we don't know because it's conceivable that there are enough people who are below the threshold of detecting symptoms, so that the denominator that equation, might be larger. Hence the death rate, maybe less, but even that is a serious case fatality rate because seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of 0.1%,\" Fauci said. \"Therefore, you have somewhat of a serious potential.\"\n",
            "\nHe called it \"a serious virus that we're taking very seriously.\"\n",
            "\nTrump's attempt Wednesday to reassure also did not quell economic jitters, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping sharply Thursday for a fourth day in a row.\n",
            "\nIn a sign the White House had its eye on the economy, the administration on Thursday afternoon that two key economic officials, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, would join the president's coronavirus task force.\n",
            "\nU.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams would also join the group, the announcement from Pence and Azar said.\n",
            "\nWhite House Deputy press secretary Judd Deere told ABC News Thursday that Trump was \"receiving regular  updates on the coronavirus through meetings and phone calls today,\" although he did not provide more details, and the president's public schedule did not mention anything related to the virus.\n",
            "\nThe vice president's office announced Thursday that Pence has appointed a physician to serve in his office as the \"White House coronavirus response coordinator.\" Ambassador Debbie Birx, who has led the U.S. government's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS since 2014, will report to Pence in the new position.\n",
            "\n\"She has deep experience in coordinating across agencies,\" Pence's office said in announcing Birx's new role. \"She has worked from the research bench to the clinic, but understands the primary focus must always be to reach the individuals most in need.

            "\n\"Everybody has to be vigilant and be careful, but be calm. It's working out. A lot of good things will happen,\" Trump said. \"The consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now.\"\n",

            "\nWhen asked why he wouldn't get tested after interacting with GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Doug Collins over the weekend, Trump said he isn't showing no symptoms and that his doctor hasn't prescribed it.\n",

I feel very good, but I guess -- it's not a big deal to get tested-- so it's something I would do,\" he said. \"But again I spoke to the White House doctor, a terrific guy, a talented guy, and he sees no reason to do it. There's no symptoms.\"",
            "\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow were on hand to meet with GOP leaders.\n",
            "\nTrump hurled insults at the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jay Powell, Tuesday morning, appearing to try to distance himself from stock market losses as the market grows close to ending its 11-year bull market.\n",
            "\n\"Our pathetic, slow moving Federal Reserve, headed by Jay Powell, who raised rates too fast and lowered too late, should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations.

Also, stimulate!\" the president tweeted. \"The Federal Reserve must be a leader, not a very late follower, which it has been!\"",
            "\nThe president's proposals come on the heels of Democrats suggesting their own sweeping stimulus plan they said focuses on everyday American workers.\n",
            "\n\"We're always willing to discuss something that is evidence- and science-based, that addresses the needs of families first as we go forward, because that is what needs to be done,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Monday before the briefing.",
            "\n\"This is very serious, and I don't know how seriously it was taken at first by the administration in terms of decisions that were made about tests and about turning down tests that were proven to be worthy. The list is a long one about not filling the positions that they vacated at the National Security Council that addressed this kind of a challenge in terms of epidemics and the rest,\" she continued. \"So, again, we have to see what it is.\"",
            "\nLater Monday night, Pelosi also released a \"Dear Colleague\" letter, reading, \"in light of reports that the Trump Administration is considering new tax cuts for major corporations impacted by the coronavirus, Leader Schumer and I released a statement calling on the Administration to prioritize the health and safety of American workers and their families over corporate interests.\"\n",

            "\nWhen asked on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" how the president might be feeling Monday morning ahead of a busy day, Senior White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega said: \"I think it's safe to say the economic impacts of the coronavirus have President Trump this morning very agitated, very worried.\"\n",
            "\n\"The Democrats are really hoping that the White House will focus on what they're calling individuals, essentially real people, working American families but here's the reality -- not even all Republicans are on board with the payroll tax,\" Vega said. \"It's been floated before and have not been able to get widespread support, so a lot remains to be seen over whether they can pull it off.\"\n",
            "\nFormer President Barack Obama pushed Congress to cut the payroll tax nine years ago to stimulate the economy -- but it's unlikely if Democrats will jump on board unless parts of their plan are included in the deal with the White House, she added.",
            "\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams also appeared on \"Good Morning America\" Tuesday morning, to detail the state of the federal government's response. Adams said they have moved from containment to mitigation.\n",
            "\n\"Initially we had a containment posture, and that's outward facing, that's saying we want to keep cases outside our community and that works when you know where the cases are coming from. Originally over 95% were coming from Japan. Now most of the cases are actually coming from Europe, South Korea and Iran and we're looking at mitigation,\" Adams said.",
            "\n\"Mitigation means within your community: how do you lower the impact of the virus and prevent it from spreading within those communities and things like school closures and pulling down large social gatherings and telework policies. Those are all steps that folks should be thinking about in case they have an outbreak in their communities,\" he continued. \"People should know that this is going to likely get worse before it gets better.\"\n",
            "\nTrump has touted his decision to close the U.S. border to China as the \"best\" and a \"Godsend,\" but Adams confirms that most cases are now being spread within American communities, not from foreign travelers entering the U.S.",
            "\nWhen asked why the U.S. is so far behind in number of tests performed, compared to 10,000 tests in South Korea and 20,000 in the U.K, Adams said it's because the tests are more regulated in the U.S. He implied it's about quality over quantity and said that 4 million more tests will be ready by the end of the week.\n",
            "\n\"When we looked at the test that was going on in other parts of the world, they weren't being held to the same quality standards that people in America expect and FDA regulations require,\" Adams said. \"The American people don't really care about the total number of tests so much as they care about whether or not they can get a test. We have over a million tests that have gone out earlier this week. We expect 4 million by the end of the week and we want to get to a place where every American can rapidly get tested if their doctor says they should and can get the results back.\"\n",
            "\nThe Surgeon General was also asked if big, campaign rallies are wise considering the threat of community spread. He didn't provide a yes or no answer but said to know your risk and know your circumstances.\n",
            "\n\"If you are in one of those high risk groups, you should think carefully about the steps you can take to keep yourself safe. If you're one of these candidates out there, make sure you're washing your hands frequently and using hand sanitizer. Consider an elbow bump or chest tap. We don't want people to put themselves at any undue risk.\"",
            "\nWhen Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the president's coronavirus task force, was asked the same question at Monday night's news briefing, he provided a similar answer to Adams', saying it's an \"evolving thing.\"\n",
            "\n\"I can't comment on campaign rallies. It really depends where we are having -- as we have all said -- this is something in motion. This is an evolving thing,\" he said. \"If you are talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment. If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that is a judgment call and if someone decides they want to cancel it I wouldn't publicly criticize them.\"\n",
            "\nThe president is expected to announce Tuesday a campaign rally scheduled for next week, while cities across the country are cancelling events such as Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade and Austin's SXSW Festival amid coronavirus concerns.",
            "\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement Monday night confirming earlier ABC News reporting that the president has not been tested for the coronavirus.\n",

The new disease, now called COVID-19, originated, like many other coronaviruses, in an animal. While coronaviruses in animals usually don't cause humans many problems, when the virus manages to spread from animals to a human, and then rapidly among many people, there can be global consequences.",
            "\nInitially, only people in Wuhan, China, -- where COVID-19 originated -- were infected. Now, the illness has been found in 37 countries around the globe, including the United States, and cases of COVID-19 are appearing without a known source of exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
            "\n\"The fact this virus has caused illness -- including illness resulting in death -- and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director for the National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said in a briefing Wednesday. \"These factors meet two of the criteria of the pandemic.\"\n",
            "\nGenerally, the third criteria for a pandemic is worldwide spread.\n",
            "\n\"For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large scale severe disease or deaths,\" Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization emphasized earlier this week.",

The \"Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza United States 2017\" outlines what can be done at both the individual and community levels during a pandemic when there is no vaccine yet.

Even if infected, \u201cpatients could be cured completely within two to three weeks,\" as long as the patient has no underlying disease, Health and Welfare Minister Park Neung-hoo said at a televised briefing on Friday.

Specific materials in the walls and ceiling eliminate the virus' chances of hiding in the shadows when the rooms are disinfected.",
            "\nAngela Vasa, a nurse manager and director of quarantine services for the National Quarantine Unit at UNMC, has been there since the first patient arrived.\n",

            "\n\"We try to really relay facts to our patients. And, you know, when you have individuals who are in a high-risk group, it really is the best. Honesty really is the best policy,\" she told ABC News.",
            "\nVasa said they're still in the \"containment\" phase of their response to COVID-19, trying their best to mitigate the spread of the infection, which has already been diagnosed in over 95,000 people worldwide, killing at least 3,200 of them -- mostly in China.",
            "\nEach unit at UNMC serves its own purpose.\n",
            "\n\"The National Quarantine Unit ... is set up to provide isolation care, which means that you would be able to provide accommodation for people who have confirmed infection with a high-risk pathogen,\" Vasa said, noting that it's the only federally funded quarantine unit in the U.S. \"They are people who would otherwise potentially be eligible for home isolation, but for whatever reason, they don't have the capability to remain at home.\"",
            "\nAlthough most patients only present mild symptoms of the infection, like cough and fever, others could go on to develop severe and sometimes deadly complications. If they require hospitalization, Vasa said that's when the Biocontainment Unit comes into play.\n",
            "\nIt's where they \"provide the full spectrum of medical care up to and including critical care,\" Vasa said.",
            "\nOne of the patients at UNMC, 66-year-old Carl Goldman, previously told ABC News that he'd been diagnosed with COVID-19 during his evacuation from the Diamond Princess. He said within hours he began feeling feverish and started coughing up mucus while at the hospital. For the most part, however, he said his symptoms have been mild.",
            "\nThe highly trained staff at UNMC has dealt with viral outbreaks of this magnitude before. The Biocontainment Unit was first opened in 2005 \"largely as a result of ... the 9/11 attacks,\" Vasa said.\n",

            "\n\"What it takes to activate our unit is really a pathogen that's considered highly hazardous and communicable,\" Vasa said. \"So anything that would be easily transmissible from person to person that doesn't necessarily have a vaccination or a therapeutic -- it's not curable.\"",
            "\n\"That's something that is a public health concern because we don't have any immunity or [it] would cause public panic,\" she continued.\n",
            "\nVasa said the challenge with COVID-19 is that the \"spectrum of presentation of symptoms\" is so wide that those with mild illnesses might not even realize they have COVID-19, and therefore they might not stay home.",
            "\n\"As people that have jobs and families and responsibilities, people don't always notice that they have an irritating cough, that it might be something that's serious,\" Vasa said. \"And so, I think when we look at the potential community spread for this when you have a large number of people with mild illness, there's potential that they could be spreading it and not even know.\"",

            "\nUNMC is working with the National Institutes of Health on a clinical trial to see how effective the antiviral drug remdesivir is against COVID-19.

            "\n\u201cThere is a whole continuum of mitigation steps that one could do\u201d in an epidemic, an outbreak, or a pandemic, he said. \u201cIt can be indicated under certain circumstances that it might make sense to close a school or schools or other measures like this...Of course, every option needs to be on the table.\u201d\n",

            "\nAs the coronavirus continues its spread around the globe, a single word is coming from the mouths of experts at an alarmingly growing rate: pandemic. But what exactly is a pandemic and does this qualify?\n",
            "\nFirst, it's important to realize coronaviruses are actually a group of respiratory diseases and we've seen them spread from China to other countries previously. The new disease, now called COVID-19, originated, like many other coronaviruses, in an animal. While coronaviruses in animals usually don't cause humans many problems, when the virus manages to spread from animals to a human, and then rapidly among many people, there can be global consequences.",
            "\nInitially, only people in Wuhan, China, -- where COVID-19 originated -- were infected. Now, the illness has been found in 37 countries around the globe, including the United States, and cases of COVID-19 are appearing without a known source of exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
            "\n\"The fact this virus has caused illness -- including illness resulting in death -- and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director for the National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said in a briefing Wednesday. \"These factors meet two of the criteria of the pandemic.\"\n",
            "\nGenerally, the third criteria for a pandemic is worldwide spread.\n",
            "\n\"For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large scale severe disease or deaths,\" Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization emphasized earlier this week.",
            "\nBut on Thursday as more and more nations reported new cases, Ghebreyesus warned, \"No country should assume it wouldn't get cases. That could be a fatal mistake, quite literally.  This virus does not respect borders. It does not distinguish between races or ethnicities.\" Once again, warning \"This virus has pandemic potential.\"\n",
            "\nFor now, the WHO is still referring to the COVID-19 situation as an outbreak or epidemic that has the potential to become a pandemic.\n",
            "\nDr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, agreed, stating, \"I believe that we are on the brink of a global pandemic at this time, with cases now on six of seven continents, and only sparing Antarctica.\"\n",
            "\nIn 2003, another coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, originated in a bat and eventually spread to humans, infecting people in Asia. The SARS outbreak spread to more than 20 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia before it was eventually contained. The WHO never officially declared it a pandemic.",
            "\nDr. Eric Cioe-Pe\u00f1a, director of Global Health at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, New York, has a different take on the new coronavirus.\n",
            "\n\"By the strictest definition of a pandemic, this meets it,\" he said. \"Any type of activity that is higher than normal background disease activity that crosses the world is a pandemic. I think we're there.\"",
            "\nCalling it a \"pandemic would be admitting we cannot stop it,\" he said, which might explain public health officials' reluctance to use the \"pandemic\" label. He predicted that the CDC would probably call it a pandemic soon because more cases will be coming to the U.S. and \"we're going to have to deal with it.\"\n",
            "\nThe U.S. currently has 60 cases, but 45 can be attributed to passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, previously docked in Japan, and repatriation flights from China.",
            "\nWhile this may be concerning, the CDC says it has been preparing for pandemic circumstances. The \"Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza United States 2017\" outlines what can be done at both the individual and community levels during a pandemic when there is no vaccine yet. While the guidelines were initially geared for an influenza pandemic, the CDC is adjusting its recommendations to address COVID-19 specifically.\n",
            "\nIt's not clear what the practical implications would be if the CDC or WHO declared a COVID-19 pandemic. There are no immediate policy or financial strategies that are automatically triggered once something is declared a pandemic.\n",
            "\nCOVID-19 has already been declared a public health emergency by the WHO and the U.S. government.\n",
            "\nThe bottom line is that while COVID-19 hasn't yet been declared a pandemic, if it does become one, public health officials are asking Americans to be prepared.\n",
            "\nABC News Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton says to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.\n",
            "\n\"Prepare as if there were a severe storm coming. Have extra food on hand. Make plans on how to take care of your loved ones. Prepare yourself mentally,\" she said.\n",
            "\nDespite the rapid spread around the world, many of the confirmed COVID-19 illnesses have had mild symptoms.\n",
            "\n\"Most people who get novel coronavirus are going to stay at home,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. \"They are going to treat it how they would treat a severe flu or cold, managing symptoms, and we will publish clear information [about] when you should seek medical attention.\"\n",

            "\nBased on data from previous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, some experts believe pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe illness and death, but that data is limited and inconclusive.\n",

            "\nThe CDC recommends the general public, including pregnant women, take \"everyday preventive actions\" to help stop the spread of germs, including getting a flu vaccine, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, staying home when sick and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.\n",
            "\nFurther precautions, including avoiding crowds and stocking up on supplies, are recommended only for older people or people with severe chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and lung disease.\n",

            "\nPerson-to-person transmission is mostly likely between people in close contact, within about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or possibly be inhaled by those people.\n",
            "\nThere is no guidance that pregnant women should not travel, so it's ultimately a personal decision.\n",

            "\nWhen first responders answered roughly 10 calls from a long-term care center in Kirkland, Washington, over the course of a week, they did not expect to become patients themselves.",
            "\nEntering the Life Care Center of Kirkland last month exposed them to the novel coronavirus that sickens people with an illness known as COVID-19. Because the emergency calls came before authorities realized the virus was circulating in the community, some of the responders did not wear protective gear.",
            "\nAs of Thursday, 27 firefighters and three police officers were under quarantine. Twelve are showing flu-like symptoms. Two other responders were released from isolation. The virus has infected 70 people and killed 10 in Washington state. One person has also died in California.",
            "\nThat cluster of COVID-19 cases highlights a new threat faced by the nation\u2019s first responders \u2014 including emergency medical technicians, ambulance crews and some firefighters. Emergency preparedness managers and organizations representing first responders around the country acknowledged that a severe outbreak like the one in Kirkland could put their normal contingency plans to the test.",
            "\nLocalities that run out of protective gear \u2014 already in short supply \u2015 may have to turn to the federal government for help, the International Association of Fire Fighters said. Communities that typically rely on one another for help may not be able to do so if the virus overwhelms their region.",
            "\nIf the virus drives up demand for services, communities may also see a change in how calls are prioritized and, if workforce ranks are diminished, how fast responders arrive, say experts on emergency preparedness. That means dispatchers may be more selective about when to send an ambulance, said Dr. John Hick, medical director for emergency preparedness at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.",
            "\nIn a worst-case scenario, he said, they may ask less seriously ill patients to find their own transportation to the hospital.",
            "\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like saying, Are you ready for a house fire, right? The house is going to get damaged,\u201d Hick said about preparing for the worst. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do the best we can to keep the damage to a minimum.\u201d",
            "\nTo be sure, no one knows how widespread COVID-19 will be in the United States. As of publication, researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who are tracking the outbreak report at least 230 confirmed cases in nearly 20 states.",
            "\nDespite the uncertainty, plans are underway. To help guide emergency personnel, dispatchers are ramping up their screening of callers to identify potential cases of the coronavirus. Hospital emergency management directors are reviewing how to conserve and repurpose in-demand supplies. And EMT and fire departments are taking inventory to make sure they have enough protective equipment for responders in the field.",
            "\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to cookie-cutter anything,\u201d said Doug Stern, media relations director for the International Association of Fire Fighters. He said first responders are using their past experiences plus information from the current outbreak to form their working framework.",
            "\nOne way first responders protect themselves in situations with a serious infection risk is by wearing personal protective equipment. Gowns, goggles and gloves create a barrier that reduces the chance a worker will be exposed to the germ.",
            "\nTypically, first responders choose what gear to wear based on information from the dispatcher while en route to the scene, Stern said. Not every situation requires protective gear. In some cases, items like gowns can hinder responders from being able to react quickly.",
            "\n\u201cIn an ICU, you\u2019re working in a controlled condition,\u201d said Stern. \u201cOur firefighters are not working in controlled conditions. They\u2019re working in whatever environment they get thrown into.\u201d",
            "\nIn Kirkland, firefighters are now wearing personal protective equipment when responding to any calls from the Life Care Center, said the city\u2019s spokesperson.",

            "\nAndrew Yurek, director of safety and emergency management at Northfield Hospital & Clinics in Minnesota, said his system has what they need for now, but he is already having trouble ordering more items. He is reviewing every back order and solidifying plans for alternatives the system can use to conserve the stockpile.",
            "\n\u201cEveryone in the world is looking for the same stuff,\u201d Yurek said, \u201cand we are in the same boat.\u201d",
            "\nEven if departments have enough supplies, Stern said, work by the dispatchers is key to determining whether the situation warrants extra protective equipment.",
            "\n\u201cThe linchpin in all of this is making sure that the dispatchers are asking the questions that help the firefighters prepare on their way,\u201d he said.",
            "\nYurek said his department is coordinating with dispatchers to ask callers questions about signs of respiratory illness and travel history.",
            "\nThe International Association of Fire Fighters is recommending to local fire unions that their dispatchers also be encouraged to ask for additional information, Stern said.",
            "\nFirst responders face grueling work conditions even without the threat of a novel virus. Paramedics and emergency personnel have among the highest rates of illness and injury of any job, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.",
            "\nIn the event of an outbreak, first responders sickened by COVID-19 could create gaps in the workforce at a time when their services may be in high demand. And they may be gone for a substantial amount of time \u2014 the CDC recommends that those exposed to the virus be quarantined for 14 days.",
            "\n\u201cThe fewer emergency medical technicians there are,\u201d Hick said, \u201cthe more pressure they\u2019re under to \u2026 do whatever they have to do to answer those calls.\u201d",
            "\nTypically, departments that are overwhelmed by a disaster rely on mutual aid or an agreement that enables communities to share first responders. But this assumes that COVID-19 won\u2019t engulf neighboring areas, Stern said, which might not be the case.",
            "\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a finite number of people that can come,\u201d said Dr. Ray Fowler, chief of the division of emergency medical services in the emergency medicine department at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \u201cSo we have to work to protect those folks.\u201d",

            "\nUntil now, health officials said they'd hoped to prevent community spread in the United States. But following community transmissions in Italy, Iran and South Korea, health officials believe the virus may not be able to be contained at the border and that Americans should prepare for a \"significant disruption.\"\n",
            "\nThis comes in contrast to statements from the Trump administration. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Tuesday the threat to the United States from coronavirus \"remains low,\" despite the White House seeking $1.25 billion in emergency funding to combat the virus. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC\u2019s Kelly Evans on \u201cThe Exchange\u201d Tuesday evening, \"We have contained the virus very well here in the U.S.\"",
            "\n\"Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday at a news conference.\n",
            "\nMessonnier added that Americans should channel their concern about the virus, officially called COVID-19, into preparing for its arrival.",
            "\nOfficials said that Americans should continue to practice protective measures -- hand-washing, staying home from work when sick -- while local officials should make sure systems are in place -- teleschooling, working remotely -- should face-to-face interactions need to be reduced. Health care facilities should be prepared to increase telehealth systems and delay elective surgeries should the need arise, they said.\n",
            "\nMessonnier noted that every community's response will be different. What's appropriate for a community with local transmission may not be appropriate for a community in which no local transmissions has occurred.\n",
            "\nSo far there has been no community spread in the United States. Forty-three people repatriated on charter flights from Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive for COVID-19, and 15 cases have been detected in the United States via the country's health system. Among those 57 cases, only two involved human transmission in the United States, and those transmissions were among members of the same household.",
            "\nHealth Secretary Alex Azar told reporters at a Tuesday afternoon press conference that the United States would be undertaking \"the most aggressive containment efforts in modern history\"\n",
            "\n\"We are going to continue taking those measures but we are realistic that we will see more cases and as we see more cases we might have to take community mitigation efforts,\" he said.\n",

            "\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the request \"long overdue and completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency.\" She also accused President Trump of leaving \"critical positions in charge of managing pandemics at the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security vacant.\"",
            "\n\"The president's most recent budget called for slashing funding for the Centers for Disease Control, which is on the front lines of this emergency. And now, he is compounding our vulnerabilities by seeking to ransack funds still needed to keep Ebola in check,\" Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday morning. \"Our state and local governments need serious funding to be ready to respond effectively to any outbreak in the United States. The president should not be raiding money that Congress has appropriated for other life-or-death public health priorities.\"\n",
            "\nShe added that lawmakers in the House of Representatives \"will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis.\"",
            "\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also called the Trump administration's request \"too little too late.\"\n",

            "\nAt the same time, Bruce Aylward, an epidemiologist who led a team of international experts in China, said that the epidemic is slowing in China.\n",
            "\nIn addition to a falling rate of new infections, hospital beds are opening up and there's no wait for tests at fever clinics, Aylward explained. It's impossible to know if this trend of decreasing cases will continue, but for now, Aylward thinks China's response to the outbreak, which included rapidly building hospitals and imposing strict lockdown measures in cities hardest hit by the virus, is working.\n",
            "\n\"The implications are that you can actually effect the course of this disease, but it takes a very aggressive and tough program,\" Aylward said at a WHO news briefing in Geneva on Tuesday.\n",

            "\nAlthough the virus \"absolutely\" has the potential to become a pandemic, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it's still too soon to classify it that way.\n",
            "\n\"For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or deaths,\" he told reporters at a press conference in Geneva on Monday. \"Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely it has. Are we there yet from our assessment? Not yet.\"",

            "\nCappelli said employers should start by \"figuring out what are our essential jobs, and what are the jobs that have to be done from our office, and how do we think about getting that work done.\"\n",
            "\nThis is \"not so obvious by looking at a work chart,\" he said, noting that \"the people at the top\" often end up being \"very expendable,\" but the \"people who are manning certain types of equipment are very, very important.\"\n",
            "\n\"Understanding how vulnerable you are is really a big deal, that starts with what absolutely has to be done in the office versus what has to be done remotely, then thinking about the most-likely threats,\" Cappelli said.\n",
            "\nIn terms of managing a remote workforce, Cappelli said the most important thing is \"being clear about performance.\"\n",
            "\n\"One of the things that working remotely makes clear is that if you're not managing people well, it becomes even more obvious when they're working remotely,\" he said.\n",
            "\n\"A lot of managers just believe that if someone is home they\u2019re just watching, 'I Dream of Jeannie' all day,\" he said. \"What that forces you, as a manager, is to think about what do we really want you to do this week, how are we going to see that, how are we going to check in.\"",
            "\nDenise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, told ABC News that now is the time for employers to dust off or design some work from home guidelines.\n",
            "\n\"Be output-focused, not process-focused. Make explicit what expectations are,\" Rousseau added of those guidelines.\n",
            "\n\"Most of these practices are not rocket science, you could run a test for three days and then come out ahead, that\u2019s a way to show you\u2019re calm and competent,\" she said.",
            "\nRousseau cited a handful of universities in Hong Kong that \"are using a capacity they already developed, which is online classes, to do regular classes,\" amid the outbreak, and urged businesses to think about what tools and resources they already \"already have the capacity to do, that if we do on a broader scale could keep this going.\"\n",
            "\nA handful of major companies in Asia are also already requiring employees to work remotely amid the outbreak.\n",
            "\nWhile Rousseau acknowledges there may be a \"learning curve,\" she said that studies have shown that with technology most workers are just as, if not more, productive at home than they are in an office.\n",
            "\nJaime Klein, the founder and CEO of Inspire Human Resources, and told ABC News she is already preparing for how to manage her team of more than two dozen employees should an outbreak erupt in New York City, and is also advising clients on how to respond to the outbreak.\n",
            "\nKlein said the biggest factor in getting ahead of the curve is to make sure that collaborative tools are in place for success, such as teleconferencing software.\n",
            "\n\"We don't want to assume that all clients have the tools like Slack, Zoom, Skype etc.,\" she said.\n",
            "\n\"I found that productivity is incredibly high when people work remotely,\" she said, adding that many people \"get back an hour plus or two and half hours to your day without a commute.\"\n",
            "\nShe noted that tech software such as Trello, Slack and Zoom are very important, but that \"like any muscles, it's all about practicing.\"\n",
            "\n\"What you can do is be realistic about what can be accomplished remote and what can't,\" she said. \"Think about security issues -- can this be scanned online, does it have to be photocopied and brought home?\"",
            "\nKlein said that ultimately, however, her message to her team is to put their health and their families' health first. If they choose to not take a flight or do an onsite, \"I want to signal to them that it is taken very seriously.\"\n",
            "\n\"When these things happen I think the strongest companies and the strongest leaders lead with comfort and they lead with heart,\" she said. \"If they are not taking care of these families when these things happen, there is no way they are going to be productive.\"\n",
            "\nFor factories, restaurants, retail and more, working from home may not be feasible amid an outbreak.\n",
            "\n\"I think employers are going to be challenged by the fact that they still have to pay bills during this time, as do employees,\" Rousseau told ABC News.\n",
            "\n\"The biggest problem is factories, where people need to be physically there to get the work done,\" she added. \"It's very hard to assemble something at a distance.\"\n",
            "\n\"Those are environments where I think they will be much more burdened to create sanitary conditions,\" Rousseau said.\n",
            "\nCappelli reiterated that for manufacturing, service industry jobs and retail, \"it's quite a different exercise\" because working remotely cannot be done.\n",
            "\n\"Retail has the additional problem in that it's not just your employees that can be sick, all those people coming into your stores that might be sick,\" he said. \"So if you\u2019re a Walmart or a hotel, what are you going to do? Are you going to shut down? And if not, what are the protocols going to be to keep your employees safe from the customers?\"\n",

Still, the development of a vaccine is not the only hurdle in the process of combating a disease outbreak like COVID-19.",

            "\nAfter that decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the White House on Friday declared the 2019 novel coronavirus a public health emergency. Additionally, any U.S. citizens returning from mainland China are being required to undergo proactive health screenings at ports of entry and spend up to 14 days in self-quarantine.\n",
            "\nThese announcement came a day after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. To date, seven cases in the U.S. have been confirmed, but almost 12,000 have been reported in China, where at least 259 have died from the disease.\n",
            "\n\"While we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented public health threat, and this is one of the tools in our toolbox to mitigate the potential impact of this virus in the United States,\" Dr. Nancy Messonier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a press briefing.",
            "\nIt's the first time in more than 50 years the CDC has issued such a quarantine.\n",
            "\n\"While there have been several isolation orders over the last many years, the last time the quarantine was used for a suspect case was in the 1960s for a smallpox evaluation,\" said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.",
            "\nIsolation and quarantine are two different tools used to restrict the spread of disease. Using isolation is much more common.\n",
            "\nBoth are legal measures available to federal and state authorities to limit exposure or prevent a potentially contagious disease from spreading. In most states, breaking a quarantine order is a criminal misdemeanor.\n",
            "\n\"'Isolation' is the legal term that refers to separating someone who is already sick, or reasonably believed to be, from healthy people, while 'quarantine' is used for isolating people that are not yet sick and may never get sick\" but may have been exposed to something contagious, said Polly Price, a law and public health professor at Emory University.\n",
            "\nThe CDC is also authorized to detain, medically examine and release people arriving in the United States or travelling between states if they're potentially infectious. The CDC routinely monitors people crossing U.S. borders for signs and symptoms of communicable diseases and may order a federal isolation or quarantine if an individual is deemed potentially infectious.",
            "\nWith the coronavirus, health officials currently believe symptoms will manifest within two weeks, so the quarantines effectively cover the incubation period for the disease, researchers believe. So far, specimen samples from passengers entering the U.S. have been negative. But that's not a guarantee.\n",
            "\n\"The testing we have available now cannot identify people in the incubation phase. This is a point-in-time, single test, and shouldn't be relied upon to make a prediction as to whether or not the person will become ill,\" said Price, echoing sentiments from the CDC. \"Until we have a better test to more rapidly determine whether someone is carrying the virus, quarantine is the best tool we have. We have to trust the government is using the best science available to institute the minimum restrictions.\"\n",
            "\nBut, Cetron, added, \"Clearly, there are cons.\"\n",
            "\nIf improperly enacted, quarantines can \"induce fear and stigma of individuals. If people aren't treated with dignity and respect and have all the supportive care, that's not the way to implement this tool.\"\n",
            "\nNot all individuals have been cooperative, CDC officials said. One person reportedly tried to leave, and officials issued a state-level California quarantine to enhance the level of protection. Authorities declined to comment further.\n",

            "\nPerson-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.\n",

            "\nCall schools and ask if there are plans for remote schooling. Figure out a childcare plan in the event schools close, and ask about remote working options. Asking more questions now hopefully means asking fewer later.\n",

            "\nWhile they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.",
            "\n\"The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,\" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but \"those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.\"",

            "\nThe CDC recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for COVID-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves.\n",
            "\nIf you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.\n",
            "\nIf you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.\n",
            "\nIf you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News\u2019 chief medical correspondent.\n",
            "\nYou should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away.\n",
            "\nYou might want to think about it.\n",
            "\nFirst, check the U.S. State Department's website, which provides travel advisories that include up-to-date recommendations about which countries have reported cases of COVID-19 and how widespread disease transmissions have been. The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check back often and use that information to inform what's essentially a personal decision.",
            "\nIf you are in a high-risk group, meaning you are an older person, or have an underlying medical condition, \"you should now be thinking about social distancing,\" Schaffner advised.\n",
            "\n\"Part of that is thinking really hard about whether you need to get on an airplane,\" he said. \"I think this is a good time to postpone those trips.\"\n",
            "\nEven if you're young, healthy and adventurous, there are additional questions to consider beyond whether the country you plan to travel to has seen a significant influx of COVID-19 cases.\n",
            "\nThink about the situation on ground. Has travel within the country been disrupted? How would you feel about the potential of being quarantined upon your return to the United States? If it's a work trip, would the situation on the ground make it difficult to be productive?\n",
            "\nEven if your trip is to a low-risk area, traveling on a plane will mean being in an enclosed space with fellow travelers. The CDC now recommends that all travelers, especially those with underlying health conditions, avoid cruise ships.\n",
            "\nThe answer may be different for different people. \"Evaluate whether this is an essential trip,\" Schaffner said.",
            "\n\"The short answer is apparently, yes, and better than we thought,\" Schaffner said.\n",
            "\nAfter China imposed strict quarantine and lockdown measures in hard-hit Hubei province, new cases of COVID-19 appeared to decline, Schaffner explained.",
            "\nIt's too soon to know the full effect of that quarantine, which is essentially an unprecedented public health experiment. And imposing strict quarantine measures on an entire community may not be replicable outside of China.\n",
            "\n\"Try doing that in New York,\" Schaffner added. \"Ain't gonna happen.\"\n",
            "\nThe World Health organization defines a pandemic as \"the worldwide spread of a new disease,\" and with clusters of COVID-19 in countries around the world, including extensive transmission in a number of them, we're certainly on the precipice of that reality.\n",
            "\nFor the United States, more transmissions in more countries, as well cases in the U.S. with no known source, raise the possibility that there will be extensive spread here.",
            "\n\"A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,\" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against \"running around like a chicken with its head cut off,\" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.\n",
            "\n\"Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,\" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss. Widespread transmission is making threat of a pandemic more real.\n",
            "\n\"It shouldn't panic you,\" Schaffner said. \"But it should get your attention.\"",
            "\nConcerned enough to pay attention. Stay on top of CDC updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. Take the time to sit down and plan for what you'll do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.\n",
            "\nEven the experts aren't completely sure what's going to happen.\n",
            "\n\"It's hard,\" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son earlier in the day that asked whether he should stock up on canned goods.\n",
            "\n\"I would be inclined not to,\" Perlman said. \"We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.\"",
            "\nCOVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with COVID-19's fatality rate believed to be around 2%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.\n",
            "\n\"For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,\" Merson said. Unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. HIV, for example, \"was very fatal, but hard to transmit,\" he added.\n",
            "\nYes, but kids rarely have severe symptoms.",
            "\nReports from China include children who have contracted COVID-19, but those children typically had very mild symptoms and the majority of cases were diagnosed in adults. Severe complications from coronavirus, like acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, are rare among kids. Similar to adults, children with underlying health problems may be at increased risk risk for complications associated with COVID-19.\n",
            "\nWe don't know.\n",
            "\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population. Based on data from previous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, some experts believe that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe illness and death, but that data is limited and far from conclusive.",
            "\nFor now, neither the CDC nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend any specific guidance for pregnant women beyond what they recommend to the general public.\n",

Forty-three people repatriated on charter flights from Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive for COVID-19, and 15 cases have been detected in the United States via the country's health system.

And now, he is compounding our vulnerabilities by seeking to ransack funds still needed to keep Ebola in check,\" Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday morning. \"Our state and local governments need serious funding to be ready to respond effectively to any outbreak in the United States. The president should not be raiding money that Congress has appropriated for other life-or-death public health priorities.\"\n",

            "\nThe United States is not ready to declare the new coronavirus a public health emergency, health officials said Tuesday, although the option is available should the situation in the U.S. change.\n",
            "\n\"I'll do it when it's appropriate,\" Alex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services, said during a news conference.",
            "\n\"It's very important to remember where we are right now,\" Azar continued, noting that only five people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus, all of whom traveled to Wuhan, China, thought to be where the outbreak originated.\n",
            "\nThere's no evidence of human-to-human transmission documented in the U.S.\n",
            "\nWhile viruses are unpredictable, Azar explained, \"The risk to any individual American is extremely low\" at this time.\n",
            "\nSeveral Congress members have called on HHS to declare coronavirus a public health emergency in order to free up additional CDC funding to address the virus.",
            "\nIn the meantime, the U.S. is stepping up airport screenings, as well as diagnostic and treatment efforts on U.S. soil.\n",
            "\nAirport screenings are being expanded to 20 airports -- passengers will be monitored for signs of illness, and travelers from China will be educated on coronavirus, in case they develop symptoms. Any traveler who's visited China and who develops respiratory symptoms should contact their health care provider.\n",
            "\nHealth care workers caring for individuals with coronavirus, as well as those around them, should be vigilant about their health.\n",

            "\nHealth officials are still determining how infectious the new coronavirus is, as well as how long its incubation period lasts. For now, that incubation period is thought to be between two and 14 days, a wide range. There's also the question of how severe it is. Current disease assessments are based on early cases, and those cases are likely to be among the most severe, since patients sought out health care treatment.\n",
            "\nWhile China has reported evidence of coronavirus transmission in asymptomatic individuals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not been able to review that data and can't confirm it, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, said during the news conference.\n",
            "\nEven if that asymptomatic transmission is confirmed, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed that asymptomatic transmission is not health officials' primary concern.",

            "\nIn addition to a diagnostic test the CDC is developing to share with states and local health departments, the NIH is working to develop a vaccine. While a vaccine would take roughly months three months to develop and additional time to test, the agency wants to be prepared for a worst-case scenario.",
            "\nThe death toll from the novel coronavirus has continued to climb in China, where at least 106 people have died among 4,500 confirmed cases.\n",
            "\nThe number of dead from the new viral disease includes the first death in, Beijing, the nation's capital, along with two dozen others in central China's Hubei province, where the first cases were detected in December.\n",
            "\nThe epicenter of the outbreak is Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Hubei province, which Chinese authorities have placed on lockdown in an effort to contain the outbreak. With the influx of patients seeking treatment, the city is racing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Feb. 3. A second 1,300-bed hospital is expected to be finished later in February.\n",
            "\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced at a press conference Tuesday that train service to mainland China will be halted, starting at midnight Thursday. Lam said two train stations connecting the semi-autonomous Chinese city to the mainland also would be closed and some flights would be canceled.\n",

That charter flight will travel to California's Ontario International Airport, where everyone on board will be screened for symptoms at the airport prior to leaving. They'll also be subject to additional screening, observation and monitoring requirements by the CDC.",
            "\nThe U.S. Department of State issued a new travel advisory on Monday urging Americans to reconsider traveling to any part of China due to the disease, rather than just to Wuhan and other affected areas. U.S. citizens are advised not to travel to Hubei province.\n",

Health authorities are now advising everyone to wear masks in the presence of others and to change into a new mask every day.",

            "\nOrganizer added that they are \"exploring options to reschedule the event and are working to provide a virtual SXSW online experience as soon as possible for 2020 participants.\"\n",
            "\nPrior to the cancellation announcement, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter joined a growing list of companies that had backed out of the festival that was set to take place in Austin, Texas, from March 13 to 22.\n",
            "\nCalling off the festival could be a major blow to the local economy. The gathering injects up to $350 million into Austin's economy, according to a 2018 analysis from Greyhill Advisors funded by South by Southwest.\n",
            "\nAs recently as Wednesday, officials said at a news conference the event was still scheduled as planned despite concerns over COVID-19, and that canceling the event wouldn't make the community safer.\n",

We are constantly monitoring that situation,\" Dr. Mark Escott, the interim medical director for Austin Public Health, told reporters Wednesday. \"One of the concerns is that if we shut down or make the recommendation to shut down South by Southwest, people will still continue to come here \u2026 but without that organizational structure that South by Southwest provides.\"",
            "\nFestival organizers said they increased the availability of handwashing and sanitizing stations as well as screening employees' and volunteers' temperatures to help allay anxieties over COVID-19, Escott added.\n",

            "\nWith cases of confirmed novel coronavirus in the United States steadily increasing, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instructing Americans to prepare for social disruptions, the uncertainty around COVID-19 has sparked anxiety and fear among the public.\n",
            "\n\"Anxiety spreads faster than the virus,\" Catherine Belling, associate professor of Medical Education at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine, said in an interview with ABC News.",
            "\nBelling, who studies the role of fear and uncertainty in the medical sphere, said it is natural to feel worried about the novel coronavirus, especially \"when our experts are not completely sure and don't know exactly what will happen.\"\n",
            "\n\"There is a difference, however, between anxiety, worry, fear and panic,\" she said. \"Panic is an irrational fear reaction that, by definition, your body's reaction and adrenaline response take over from your ability to actually rationally evaluate the situation. If you are capable of avoiding panic, that's good.\"\n",
            "\nCarnegie Mellon Professor of Public Policy and Strategy Baruch Fischhoff, who studies how people evaluate risk and make decisions, agreed.\n",
            "\n\"From a risk analysis perspective, some fear and some worry is legitimate, since the virus is still poorly understood and we don't exactly know what the health effects are or what the social effects are going to be,\" he said.",
            "\nIn the case of a virus like COVID-19, experts say it's challenging to evaluate risk or compare it to other more familiar forms of danger, since the threat is so new.\n",
            "\n\"Many more people die from the flu or motor vehicle accidents, but objectively and subjectively we don't know the bounds of the novel coronavirus risks, which adds to the concerns with this new virus,\" Fischhoff said.\n",
            "\nTo soothe worries, people search for answers -- but ominous signals such as rising death counts, strong economic impacts, major event cancelations, school closures and quarantines bias people toward experiencing fear, explained Paul Slovic, a University of Oregon professor specializing in risk perception.\n",
            "\n\"The main way we relate to information about our world is through feelings and gut intuitions,\" Slovic said.",
            "\n\"We are not good at numbers, we are good at stories,\" Belling said. \"And when we look at a dry list of suggestions and statistics, you won't know how these apply to you because these numbers don't connect to our imagination in the same way.\"\n",
            "\nThere is a fine balance, however, between sharing concern rationally in order to raise public awareness of risk and creating uncontrollable crowd panic.\n",
            "\n\"Sometimes the spread of fear can take on the form of the virus itself,\" said Dr. Abigail Schlesinger, chief of the Behavioral Science Division at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.",
            "\nIn the case of infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncontrollable spread of anxiety can more easily produce \"social problems and suspicion of other people because the virus spreads from person to person and transmission is about contact with other people,\" said Belling -- as opposed to a potentially fatal illness like cancer that is not contagious or able to spread among individuals.\n",
            "\n\"Sometimes we can go too far,\" he said, as when fear gets in the way of day-to-day activities, consumes all your thoughts, and compromises your ability to listen to experts. If you're engaging in the spread of misinformation or stigma against particular communities of people, Fischhoff said that might also be a sign that your anxiety is unhealthy.\n",
            "\nThe perpetuation of misleading information about COVID-19 has steadily emerged in parallel with the virus itself. \"Information is flying all over the world with lightning speed and changing the way we interpret what is going on in the world,\" Slovic said.",
            "\nWhile fear is a survival tool that has supported humans through evolution, \"our brains have not fully evolved to cope with the interconnectedness of our modern world,\" Slovic said. When searching for information or interacting with other users online, Slovic urges people to remember that stories and narratives are highly influential in shaping our beliefs, but are likely less reliable than objective facts.\n",
            "\n\"We sometimes have the tendency to treat people from a particular outbreak as though everyone is bad,\" said Slovac. \"That can be unfair and problematic, and does more harm than good.\"\n",
            "\nHe admits, however, that \"these are problems that go beyond coronavirus, and are endemic to our world.\"\n",
            "\n\"Emotions are rational; their role is to protect us. Fear is rational; it helps us avoid danger. You shouldn't turn your emotions off,\" said Slovac. The key, he says, is to learn how to manage your emotions properly.\n",
            "\n\"It's important to remember that worry makes it possible to prepare and prevent,\" added Belling.",
            "\n\"Generally speaking, panic is quite rare because usually people take care of one another, help one another in disasters and make the best decisions in difficult situations,\" Fischhoff said.\n",
            "\nBelling says anxiety is best managed when you understand what it means.\n",
            "\n\"Feeling anxious isn't itself a sign of danger,\" she said. \"Worry actually carries hope, and there is a possibility that bad things won't even happen.\"\n",
            "\n\"The notion that we are all overestimating risk is too simplistic,\" added Slovic. \"It's not always clear what the right response is.\"",
            "\nBelling suggests following a small number of news outlets or local health departments for the latest developments. \"Try to be rational and recognize when your worry is leading you towards a bad form of thinking,\" she said.\n",
            "\nFocus on what you can do, experts say.\n",
            "\n\"Educate yourself. Wash your hands and cough the right way. Think of this as an opportunity ... to develop better hygiene habits for the long term,\" said Schlesinger. When you do feel overwhelmed, she said, \"back away from social media and reconnect with someone who is not overwhelmed by that fear.\"\n",

Worldwide, nearly 12,000 people have been sickened, outstripping the 8,098 cases reported during the 2003 SARS outbreak. Despite the accelerating case count, however, the new coronavirus appears to be less fatal than SARS. The World Health Organization estimates that 20% of cases of the new coronavirus are considered to be severe and 2% are fatal. In comparison, the SARS' fatality rate was roughly 10%.\n",

It turned out to be a false alarm, and Italian health officials diagnosed that person with the common flu.\n",

            "\n\"The guest did not report any illness to the medical center while on board,\" Tarling said. \"On learning this information from the Hong Kong health authorities, we immediately worked with the Japanese Ministry of Health who quickly developed a response plan. All guests and crew were evaluated for symptoms of the illness and the first batch of several hundred laboratory samples was taken from individuals with symptoms or suspected to have been exposed to the virus. We were advised that a number of those tests came back positive and the ship was placed under quarantine on Feb. 5, and since then, the Japanese Ministry of Health has continued to test people with symptoms and other risk factors.\"\n",
            "\n\"I understand you may be very anxious when you hear more confirmed cases,\" he added. \"However, health authorities expected additional cases to be identified given the original case likely exposed others and their close contacts between January 20 and February 4.\"\n",
            "\nTarling said most cases on board have \"mild to moderate symptoms, like a common cold or flu, and some have no symptoms.\" More severe symptoms have been seen among a small number of individuals, typically those with pre-existing medical conditions.\n",
            "\n\"The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control believe that the virus spreads mostly from direct person-to-person contact with ill people, such as when they are coughing and sneezing,\" he said. \"These health authorities state there is no current evidence the illness spreads through the air ventilation systems. However, in an abundance of caution, we have maximized fresh air into all cabins. \"",
            "\nJapanese health officials have advised that the 14-day quarantine period will end on Feb. 19, according to Tarling.\n",
            "\n\"However, as the situation is evolving daily,\" he added, \"we do not know at this time what measures, if any, will be required before or after that date.\"\n",
            "\nNatalie Costa, the cruise director aboard the Diamond Princess, posted a video message online Thursday, saying, \"We are all hanging in there, doing fine and keeping together as a big family.\"\n",
            "\n\"A lot of questions coming in about what we're doing during the day,\" Costa continued. \"It changes, changes from hour to hour. We're manning the photos were getting deliveries out, different games and puzzles.\"\n",

            "SEOUL -- \nWhen news of the coronavirus broke, Brandon Woolfolk, an American teacher who lives with his girlfriend in Shanghai, was in the Philippines and planning to travel to Malaysia and Thailand. It was just before the Lunar New Year, the most traveled holiday in Asia.\n",
            "\nWithin his first few days in the Philippines, Woolfolk said he started receiving warning messages from friends back in China.",
            "\n\"Friends were telling us about the virus spreading on WeChat,\" he said. \"At first, we felt lucky. Like we made it out just in time. We didn\u2019t think it would get as bad as it is.\"\n",
            "\nWoolfolk is one of the approximately 900,000 foreign workers in China.  As the coronavirus continues to spread and the death toll rises, many expats are seeing their dream of working overseas turn into a nightmare.",
            "\nAs the number of infections soared and travel restrictions were put in place, cities across the country went into lockdown. Flights were cancelled. Schools closed. Masks sold out. And Woolfolk\u2019s girlfriend, Dominique Duarte, was thousands of miles away and six months pregnant with their first child.\n",
            "\nDuarte left before the holiday rush to visit family in Washington, D.C.\n",
            "\n\"I was relieved she got out and was safe,\" said Woolfolk. \"But I had nowhere to go.\"\n",
            "\n\"Our school sent us messages that classes would be cancelled until the virus was contained,\" he added. \"At first, we were told it would only be a few weeks, but then the dates kept getting pushed back. That\u2019s when we realized no one really knew what was going on.\u201d",
            "\nWoolfolk\u2019s quick holiday turned into a monthlong standby in Malaysia and Thailand, costing him thousands of extra dollars in food and lodging. As he contemplated whether he would return to the U.S. or China, he said many of his friends called it quits, out of fear, and headed to their home countries.",
            "\n\"I know people who left everything,'' he said. \"Some schools, like mine, have turned to teaching online. Others have let teachers go or asked them to just wait it out without pay.\"\n",
            "\n\"I didn\u2019t have to come back,\" he added. \"But we\u2019ve been here for 2 1/2 years, and I didn\u2019t want to leave all my material possessions.\"\n",
            "\nUltimately, the couple decided to return to Shanghai for the birth of their daughter, who\u2019s due May 5. Despite protests from friends and family, Duarte said going back to China was the best decision financially.\n",
            "\n\"Back home I don\u2019t have a job or insurance. I have that in China, plus maternity leave, so it just makes sense. It\u2019s too expensive to have the baby back home.\"\n",
            "\nSince both Woolfolk and Duarte left China and then returned, they are currently under self-quarantine.\n",
            "\n\"Some grocery stores deliver, so we cook at home ... [Dominique\u2019s] staying put until the baby comes. We have a plan with our doctor, and we feel like it\u2019s gonna be okay,\" said Woolfolk.",
            "\nDespite the looming uncertainty, the couple said they are focusing on staying positive and preparing for the arrival of their baby girl.\n",
            "\n\"I\u2019m excited,\" he said. \"Even when I was stuck [in Thailand], everywhere I went, I bought little gifts and outfits for the baby.\"\n",

            "\nThe couple said they spent their New Year holiday in Turkey, but didn\u2019t return empty-handed. Instead of  souvenirs, Bennett said they brought home N95 protective masks -- over 800 of them -- to donate to the Ningxia Medical University hospital.",
            "\n\"I\u2019ve been here for four years,\" he said. \"This is our home, so we wanted to help out. We just walked into a pharmacy ... and bought as much as we could carry.\"\n",
            "\nBennett said he and his wife were immediately tested for the virus once they returned to China, and that the testing was mandatory in order to leave the airport and enter the city.\n",
            "\n\"The hospital sent a car to pick us up. [The people] were in hazmat bio-suits. They check your passport and ID and they're putting the temperature gun to your head to check for a fever. They asked questions about our trip, and if we had been to Wuhan. We were stopped at every toll road, and again once we got to our neighborhood. Once we were cleared, they told us we had one day to get everything we needed to survive for two weeks,\" he said.\n",
            "\n\"In our [apartment] complex every family gets a [stamp] card. One person from each home is allowed to leave every two days.\" he said, adding that they feel \"very lucky\" that they had a \"stockpile\u201d of food. (The stamp card is similar to a frequent-shopper reward card, to show how many times you patronize a business. But instead of getting points, in China, you're tracked by how many times you leave and enter the building.)",
            "\nBennett says he believes the local government is doing everything possible to control the outbreak, and is glad serious safety measures are being taken, even if they are inconvenient.\n",
            "\n\"[Sandy will] watch TV in the bedroom, and I\u2019ll hang in the living room so we\u2019re not elbow-to-elbow, driving each other crazy,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not ideal, but we make it work. All you can do is take proper precautions and don\u2019t panic.\" "

The first cases were detected there back in December. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency on Jan. 31, as the number of cases climbed in China and spread overseas to other countries.",
            "\nBy Tuesday, the Chinese government reported 20,438 confirmed cases and 420 deaths on mainland China. At least 190 cases have been reported in over two dozen other nations and territories, including 11 cases in the United States.",
            "\nRoth's wife, Daisy, is from Wuhan and she took their two young daughters to visit relatives in the Chinese city in mid-January, while Roth stayed home in Neenah, Wisconsin. At the time, the threat of the novel coronavirus seemed low.\n",
            "\n\"When my family went there, we had heard about a disease that was starting to spread, but we thought it would get under control,\" Roth told ABC News in a recent interview. \"It was really kind of shocking when we saw that the entire city was locked.\"\n",
            "\n\"My first thoughts were, wow, this is a big deal,\" he added. \"My wife and two daughters are there, but also all of my in-laws are there. My wife's parents, their brothers and sisters, their children and their children's children. Everybody is in Wuhan.\"",
            "\nRoth, who lived in China for a few years, has been scrambling to get his family back home safe ever since. He said his wife and kids have been holed up in his parents-in-law's home in Wuhan, which he described as once \"very lively.\"\n",

            "\nThe United States is planning more flights to evacuate American citizens out of Wuhan, China, this week, according to the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Those flights will land at four U.S. military bases and -- similar to the evacuation flight that landed in California last week -- passengers will be quarantined upon arrival. The planes will be loaded with medical supplies and humanitarian goods, which the U.S. government hopes to deliver to Wuhan on the first leg of the journey.",
            "\nRoth said the plan is for his father-in-law and an uncle to take his wife and children to the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport, where the trio will board a charter flight back to the United States on Tuesday night. But Roth is concerned about the drive to the airport.\n",
            "\n\"They need to get to the airport and that has the challenge of driving through a city that's locked down,\" he told ABC News. \"There's going to be checkpoints everywhere. Chinese government officials or military personnel are likely to stop their car and ask why they're traveling because they shouldn't be traveling.\"",
            "\nRoth said the U.S. embassy has been in touch with Hubei provincial authorities so that checkpoint personnel have the license plate of the vehicle and the personal information of the people inside who are traveling to and from the airport.\n",
            "\n\"I think we've we've done everything that we can,\" he added. \"It's some of the hitches like that I'm concerned about. Once they're in the airport, I'm going to feel a little bit of comfort because there's going to be a lot of officials there that are looking to facilitate this evacuation.\"",
            "\nRoth said his wife's family is particularly worried about their relatives trying to get back into Wuhan after dropping off Daisy and the kids at the airport, especially if one of them falls ill.",
            "\nThe new coronavirus causes symptoms similar to pneumonia that can range from mild, such as a slight cough, to more severe, including fever and difficulty breathing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
            "\n\"They'll have to go through those checkpoints again and hopefully they will not get stopped,\" Roth told ABC News. \"But even just venturing outside and going to the airport and coming back, they're putting themselves at risk where the alternative of just staying home in the apartment would be safer. That has me worried because if they need medical care, my understanding is that it might be very difficult for them to get in Wuhan at the moment.\"\n",
            "\n\"The worst thing that could happen is if they get ill,\" he continued. \"The hospitals are overwhelmed.\"",
            "\nOnce Roth's wife and children board the flight, it's unclear where the plane will fly to in the United States. Over the weekend, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that flights entering the country from China would be rerouted to one of several airports designated for coronavirus screenings. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar has declared a public health emergency and a temporary travel ban.\n",

There's just so much uncertainty that they are undergoing right now, and just to know that they're home and they're closer to me is going to be a huge weight off of my back.\"\n",

But on that night, the country was grappling with a viral outbreak. The spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, had led to fewer cars on the road and fewer operating factories and power plants.",

            "\nSo on the night of Feb. 13, Goto noticed the beauty of the moon in an unobscured night sky as she dealt with the intense pain of contractions.\n",
            "\nThe aggressive spread of the COVID-19 kept Goto, her husband and their 2-year-old son Kai isolated in their apartment for weeks. The indefinite confinement had shifted their internal clocks and made them restless. Falling asleep had also become a challenge, they said.\n",
            "\nThe residential streets surrounding the couple's apartment, which would normally be seen brimming with life, were abandoned. The nearly 11 million people who live in Suzhou, which is about 379 miles from the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, had either evacuated or were practicing strict social isolation.\n",

            "\nThe couple weighed their options. There was a maternity-only hospital in Shanghai about an hour away. But they speculated that it might be too far.\n",
            "\nAt one point, Goto considered giving birth at home. They had a nurse practitioner friend whom they thought about asking for assistance, but that friend had left the country due to the severity of the outbreak.",
            "\nTheir only remaining option was Suzhou Kowloon Hospital \u2014 the same hospital that admitted the city's first COVID-19 patient.\n",
            "\nAdding to their concerns were memories of how difficult the birth of their first child had been, when Goto endured labor for more than 14 hours without an epidural.\n",
            "\n\"We had been stressed about it for such a long time,\" Goto said. \"When the contractions started it was like, finally, the baby will be born.\"\n",
            "\nVan Overmeire couldn't take Goto to the hospital. They didn't have a car and he needed to stay home with Kai. If Kai left to stay with family or friends, the toddler would have to be quarantined for 14 days before he was allowed back in the complex.\n",
            "\nVan Overmeire wouldn't be able to be there for the birth of his second child. Goto would have to do it alone.\n",
            "\n\"Now there was another child. There was no one to take care of him,\" Van Overmeire said. \"The necessity of me being home made the guilt tolerable.\"",
            "\nWhen the contractions came, it was also too late to call a Didi, the Chinese equivalent of Uber. Besides, Didis had become increasingly rare as the virus spread; drivers and passengers alike were concerned about exposure.\n",
            "\nThe couple had planned in advance and compiled a list of their friends who had cars. When Van Overmeire started running down the list, his first few attempts went unanswered. It was the middle of the night, after all.\n",
            "\nFinally, an answer from their friend, Zach Fredman.\n",
            "\n\"He answered immediately but sounded very sleepy,\" Van Overmeire said.\n",
            "\nBut Fredman sprang into action. He jumped into his Toyota Corolla and met Goto outside the gate of her complex.\n",
            "\nAs a precaution, a curfew had been implemented in Suzhou. No one was supposed to leave their apartments between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., though giving birth was recognized as a special exception.\n",
            "\nFifteen minutes later, Fredman and Goto arrived at the emergency room.\n",
            "\n\"At the door to the hospital, Goto said, 'OK, you can go.' And I said, 'Well no, let me at least go in there and help you get checked in,'\" Fredman said.\n",
            "\n\"I was grateful but anxious because going into the emergency room means that he could potentially get infected and might infect his family,\" Goto said of Fredman, who is the father of a 4-year-old daughter. \"I felt sorry for him.\"\n",
            "\nAfter she was checked in, nurses informed her that she wouldn't be able to use an epidural, Goto said.\n",
            "\n\"That was stressful because my first birth was so painful,\" Goto said.",
            "\nNurses asked repeatedly where her husband was. Doctors and hospital staff expected him to be there to assist with the birth. They needed him to sign documents and waivers, but instead, those duties fell to Goto.\n",
            "\n\"At the time I thought, 'I'm giving birth, why are you asking me to do all these things?'\" Goto said.",
            "\nMeanwhile, at home, Van Overmeire said he was anxious.\n",
            "\n\"I'm trying to contact her, but there's no response at all. We can't get through. The Wi-Fi is bad so that doesn't get through,\" Van Overmeire said. \"I'm just checking my phone every five minutes. I was biting my fingernails.\"\n",
            "\nNurses moved Goto to a bed and, almost immediately, she was crowning.\n",
            "\n\"There was too much going on to reflect on the fact that Ben wasn't there,\" Goto said.",

            "\nThe senator's proposal would include free tests and treatments for all of those in need and paid leave for individuals sick with the virus or for those who are forced to miss work to care for relatives. She also suggests $400 billion in new government spending to prop up the economy.\n",
            "\nThe plan comes in addition to legislation the senator released Thursday seeking to defund the president's border wall and instead use the funds to combat coronavirus.\n",
            "\n\"Rather than use taxpayer dollars to pay for a monument to hate and division, my bill will help ensure that the federal government has the resources it needs to adequately respond to this emergency,\" Warren wrote.\n",
            "\nOn Wednesday, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg released a public health preparedness plan that is designed to \"prepare hospitals for pandemics, fully fund federal government preparedness efforts, and invest in scientific research that enables resilience to emerging public health threats.\"\n",

            "\nAs the number of novel coronavirus cases continues to grow, doctors on the front lines are describing how they are preparing. Hospitals are mobilizing resources and modifying protocols as new information about the virus emerges.\n",
            "\n\"When preparing for an outbreak the main priorities are to identify, isolate, and inform,\" said Dr. Theresa Madaline, epedimiologist at Montefiore Hospital, in an interview with ABC News.\n",
            "\nDr. Michael Phillips, Chief Epidemiologist at NYU Langone Hospital said, \"Hospitals are focused but should not be panicked.\u201d\n",
            "\nThe protocols for COVID-19 are modified preparedness plans, designed for previous pandemics. \"We are utilizing or modifying plans that have been in place for pandemic influenza and SARS. We are prioritizing the travel questions but this is not much different than we were doing during the Ebola outbreaks,\u201d said Dr. David Cennimo, Assistant Professor of Medicine-Pediatrics Infectious Disease at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.",
            "\nPhillips said that at NYU Langone they are adopting previous preparadness protocols for the flu with some changes. \"The basic principles are the same but we are placing more preventative emphasis on airborne transmission,\" which means patients with flu or penumonia-like symptoms that test negative for these illnesses and other common respiratory illnesses are immediately placed under isolation for caution. Anyone coming in contact with these patients is required to wear a surgical mask and eye protection. He describes this change as a \"big shift.\u201d\n",
            "\nAcross the U.S., hospitals are also modifying screening and triage protocols to detect COVID-19 patients as early as possible. Dr. Mark Jarrett, the chief quality officer for Northwell Health says that across all 23 sites they are \"working on screening, triage and identification so that any places of entry are included and addressed.\u201d\n",
            "\nWe are conducting drills on the identification, transport, rooming and safe care of patients,\" said Brigham and Women's Hospital spokesperson, on how they are optimizing efficiency and responsiveness to a potential COVID-19 patient.",
            "\nCurrently, there is one confirmed case of COVID-19 in New York City. If number of cases in New York City were to significantly increase and NYU Langone were to receive a large number of COVID-19 patients, Phillips said they would escalate precautions to what he called a \"Level 3.\" In this situation, \"we would open our surge units, which are designated respiratory isolation units, where we cohort patients with the same respiratory infections.\"\n",
            "\nMontefiore Hospital has a similar facility, ready to be used if necessary. \"Our emerging infectious disease unit is an additional space that could be utilized if needed for this virus. We have taken extra steps to prepare this unit should we need to use it,\" said Madaline.\n",
            "\nAt Rutgers, the negative pressure rooms for airborne isolation have been checked and stand ready for use. \"If there is a large surge of patients, we may have to consider cohorting on separate wards,\u201d said Cenmino.\n",
            "\nAmong these changes, doctors report rationing medical masks and protective person equipment (PPE), like gowns, as concerns over potential shortages grow. \"We are concerned about the amount of PPE we have. We certainly are not panicked but we are focused how much we have on hand,\u201d said Phillips.\n",
            "\nLast Wednesday Alex Azar, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, told member of the House Appropriation committee, \u201cWe have 30 million surgical masks. We have 12 million N95 NIOSH-certified masks in the stockpile.\u201d The stockpile is not enough. Azar estimated that the U.S. would need at least 300 million N95 masks for healthcare workers  in the case of a larger outbreak.\n",
            "\nThe CDC currently does not recommend any healthy person wear face masks. There are two types of masks. According to the CDC, surgical masks are more loose fitting, fluid resistant, and provide the wearer protection against larger droplet. They should be worn by people who are sick with a respiratory virus in order to prevent the spread of their own germs. N95 masks or respirators, are more tight fitting, can protect against smaller particles, and must be especially adjusted for the user. N95 respirators should only be used by healthcare workers in clinical settings. Nevertheless, many among the general healthy public still continue to hoard and misuse masks.\n",
            "\n\u201cEvery medical supplier has put hospitals on allotment,\u201d said Phillips.",
            "\n\u201cWe should expect shortages of supply possibly by early March and we should start planning for that. Though these companies have factories outside of Asia, we don\u2019t know when they will start production,\u201d said Dr. Robyn Livingston, an infectious disease doctor at Children\u2019s Mercy Kansas City. \"I can say we have to be cautiously optimistic but prepare for the worst.\"\n",
            "\nNYU Langone has already implemented conservation plans, which includes taking N95 respirators from units where utilization is historically low, and instructing doctors on how to safely reuse their respirators.\n",
            "\n\"With a bit of care you can reuse that respirator for the rest of your shift,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cIt takes a while for people to change their practice and we are building up our stock in case we see a situation where we need to use a whole lot more.\u201d\n",
            "\nSome health systems are also voicing concerns that regular surgical masks are taken from public spaces. \"As a result, we are now providing masks on an as-needed basis to our patients and visitors,\u201d said a Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital spokesperson.\n",
            "\nJarrett says at Northwell Health, \"We decreased the supplies in the hospital and put them in a store where they cannot be easily accessed.  We restricted access and we are tracking the amount of N95 masks used so we will notice if someone hordes the supplies.\u201d\n",
            "\nOther hospitals say it's \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d\n",
            "\n\u201cWe are still in influenza season. We want our patients and visitors protecting others from respiratory illnesses. As of today, you are still far more likely to be exposed to influenza in a U.S. hospital lobby than COVID-19.\u201d\nDr. Oluyemi Odugbesan, an attending anesthesiologist a Denver area hospital, says that the hospital administration has also encouraged them reuse their mask the entire day. \"PPE is paramount in preventing spread between those of us on the frontlines in healthcare and so it is concerning from that standpoint,\u201d said Odugbesan.",
            "\nStates and hospitals are working together to ensure that healthcare workers\u2019 protection is not compromised. The New York State Department of Health, for example, \"has already supplied hospitals across the state with N-95 respirators and other PPE to help mitigate any supply shortages currently being realized due to COVID-19,\u201d according to Jill Montag, New York State Department of Health spokesperson.\n",

            "\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak and disagreements between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have caused global oil prices to plummet Monday, and experts say this could mean U.S. consumers are likely to see much lower prices at the gas pump.",
            "\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been driving oil prices down for weeks as it has stunted economic activity in China, the epicenter of the outbreak and the world's second-largest oil consumer. Over the weekend, OPEC members met to discuss how to deal with falling oil prices. Talks disintegrated, however, and Saudi Arabia ended up slashing its oil prices, triggering a price war and sending U.S. crude oil prices plunging by more than 25%.\n",
            "\nPrices for the American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude oil, dipped below $30 per barrel on Sunday for the first time since 2016.\u00a0\n",
            "\n\"Everyone, I think, is a little bit shocked at the tactics that have come out of the broken-down talks between OPEC, specifically with Saudi Arabia and Russia,\" Sarah McCrary, the CEO of fuel prices comparison site GasBuddy, told ABC News Monday.\n",
            "\n\"Effectively what's happened is in the wake of softening demand for oil, we had expected that there would be an agreement to lower production, to reduce supply ... and we would have a gentle change in the market,\" she added. \"That did not happen.\"\n",
            "\nInstead, the Saudis announced they were going to slash the cost of oil coming from their market. As a result, consumers can expect to see much \"lower prices at the gas pump,\" McCrary said.\n",
            "\n\"We're going to see much less expensive gas across the nation,\" she said. \"The largest element in the price per gallon that Americans pay is the cost of the oil that goes into making that gasoline.\"",
            "\nAs of Monday, the national gas price average was the cheapest it's been since last February at $2.38 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.\n",
            "\n\"For the third week, U.S. gasoline stocks decreased while demand increased,\" Jeanette Casselano, an AAA spokesperson, said in a statement Monday. \"Generally, growing demand amid declining stocks causes increases at the pump, but crude oil prices have dipped to four-year lows, signaling spring could be cheaper at the pump.\"\n",
            "\nThe trend of pump prices falling is likely continue \"through the end of the winter driving season if crude remains cheap, especially amid concerns about the coronavirus,\" the AAA said in a statement.",
            "\nThe AAA said the largest weekly price decreases have been seen in Indiana (a 12 cent decrease) as well as Michigan and Illinois (which both had an 11 cent decrease). The least expensive markets in the nation are currently Texas (where the average price is $2.06 per gallon) and Mississippi and Oklahoma (where the average price is $2.07 per gallon), according to the AAA.\n",
            "\nAs gas prices fall, however, McCrary noted that there will likely be more \"variability\" between retailers and gas stations.\n",
            "\n\"In the market for example in Miami, Florida, there is a 54 cent difference between filling up in one location versus the other,\" she said. \"While the overall effect will be a lower price of gas, consumers have to be careful about where they fill up.\"\n",
            "\nWhile it means lower prices at the pump, the oil price war coupled with continued economic uncertainty over coronavirus has sent financial markets plummeting Monday.\n",
            "\nThe oil price war has raised concerns over the U.S. energy industry, and how it will be able to keep up with slashed global oil prices. When Saudi Arabia slashed its oil prices in 2014, it led to layoffs in the U.S. energy industry.\n",

The huge discrepancy compared to other countries reflects how quickly South Korea\u2019s numbers have been rising, experts say.\n",
            "\nThe total number of confirmed cases so far in South Korea is 1,766, up 505 from the day before. Of the 66,00  people who have been tested, more than 25,000 are still awaiting lab results.",

This new idea shortens time spent on testing to just 10 minutes per person since the medics do not have to change quarantine suits for every patient.\n",

            "\nShe said the issue is exacerbated by the nature of the job.\n",
            "\n\"Think about the job of a fast food worker. You are exposed to hundreds and hundreds of people. You can\u2019t telecommute,\" she said. \"It\u2019s all well and good for a Merrill Lynch or IBM to say, 'Stay home work from home.' If you work at Walmart or McDonald's or a local hospital you are exposed to contaminants and then you are exposed to the population.\"\n",

            "\nElise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank, said even if fast food workers find a way to stay home when sick, directives to seek medical attention go unheeded for the uninsured.\n",
            "\n\"Seventy-three percent of workers have paid sick days, so about a quarter don\u2019t. And these are often the low wage jobs, the service sector,\" Gould said. \"Hourly workers take care of children and the elderly. Those who work as home health aides -- or in retirement homes or nursing homes. Children don\u2019t seem to be at risk themselves, but they have the ability to spread the disease. And they have less respiratory etiquette.\"\n",
            "\n\"Staying home or working from home can be easy for upper middle class people with good jobs,\" she added. \"The recommendations from the CDC -- all the common sense things -- could lead to economic catastrophe for the low-wage worker. This whole situation shows in painstaking detail how fragile our safety net is.\""

It's impossible to know if this trend of decreasing cases will continue, but for now, Aylward thinks China's response to the outbreak, which included rapidly building hospitals and imposing strict lockdown measures in cities hardest hit by the virus, is working.\n",
            "\n\"The implications are that you can actually effect the course of this disease, but it takes a very aggressive and tough program,\" Aylward said at a WHO news briefing in Geneva on Tuesday.\n",
            "\nAs of Tuesday, China's National Health Commission said it's received 77,658 reports of confirmed cases and 2,663 deaths on the Chinese mainland. More than 83% of the cases and all but one death were in Hubei province, which includes the city of Wuhan. Chinese authorities have since placed the city under lockdown.\n",
            "\nAn additional 121 confirmed infections have been reported in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao as well as Taiwan, with two deaths in Hong Kong and one in Taiwan, according to China's National Health Commission.\n",
            "\nWHO experts in China are currently reporting a 2% to 4% fatality rate in Wuhan and a 0.7% fatality rate outside the city. For mild cases of the disease, there's a roughly two-week recovery rate, and for more severe cases, the recovery rate is between three and six weeks.\n",
            "\nCOVID-19 causes symptoms similar to pneumonia, ranging from the mild, such as a slight cough, to the more severe, including fever and difficulty breathing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is no vaccine yet for the virus.",
            "\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus has continued to spread overseas, with at least 2,069 confirmed cases in at least 33 other countries, resulting in at least 33 fatalities, according to the latest data from the WHO, which has declared the epidemic a global health emergency.\n",
            "\nAlthough the virus \"absolutely\" has the potential to become a pandemic, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it's still too soon to classify it that way.\n",
            "\n\"For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or deaths,\" he told reporters at a press conference in Geneva on Monday. \"Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely it has. Are we there yet from our assessment? Not yet.\"",

            "\nThe recent spike in cases prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a warning on Monday advising Americans to avoid traveling to South Korea. The federal agency raised its travel warning to the highest level for those contemplating travel to the East Asian nation.",
            "\nThe heightened warning came on the same day that officials said a relative of a U.S. service member in South Korea had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. In a press release, U.S. Forces Korea announced that it had been informed by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that a military dependent living in Daegu had tested positive for COVID-19.\n",

            "\nAll those who have been infected were brought ashore for treatment, while the rest were confined to their rooms until the quarantine period ends. Passengers who have tested negative for the virus have been disembarking the ship since last Wednesday.",

            "\nAs of Tuesday, Italy's Ministry of Health had recorded 322 confirmed cases and 10 fatalities. The majority of those cases were in the northern Lombardy region, prompting some towns to suspend public gatherings, demonstrations and sporting events and to close schools, businesses and restaurants.\n",
            "\nThe initial cases in Italy were linked to Chinese tourists, according to the health ministry.\n",
            "\nSyracuse University in upstate New York alerted students Tuesday that it was closing its Florence campus for the semester and helping the 342 students who were studying there return home.\n",

In fact, watching this disease grow and spread across Asia, I became convinced a number of things seemed likely to happen. First, that this virus could sweep the globe, spreading from East to West and that eventually, most of us would know what it was like to live with COVID-19 in our countries, if not our communities.",

            "\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday morning he's preparing a detailed Democratic request for emergency coronavirus funding totaling $8.5 billion. It's expected to be finalized Wednesday and sent to appropriators.\n",
            "\nFollowing Schumer's announcement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday morning called the president's $2.5 billion request to combat coronavirus \"anemic.\"",
            "\n\"What he's doing is late -- too late -- anemic,\" Pelosi said. \"Hopefully, we can make up for the loss of time, but it will have to have the professionals in place, the resources that are adequate and not be using scare tactics about people coming back to our country.\"\n",
            "\nShe said the House will have a proposal \"similar\" to the plan put forth by the Senate.\n",
            "\nAt the Wednesday briefing at the White House, Trump said he would be open to more money from Congress.",
            "\nCDC Director Anthony Fauci said that since a potential vaccine would take a year and a half to develop, in order to contain the virus in the short term, the focus had to remain on public health measures.",

            "\n\"We do expect more cases and this is a good time to prepare. As you heard, it's the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities and schools, to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off and make sure they are ready and we have lots more information at the CDC's website and in partnership on how to do that,\" she said during Wednesday's news conference.\n",

            "\nTrump acknowledged coronavirus had played a role, but he also said investors' fears of a Democrat winning the presidency this year had contributed, too.\n",
            "\nHe specifically pointed to concern over remarks by the Democratic presidential candidates at a debate Tuesday night, when they criticized Trump's handling of the response to the virus. He said comments by the candidates, who he called \"Democrat fools,\" had made \"a huge effect\" on markets.\n",
            "\nBut the largest drops in the Dow Jones came before the debate -- and the decrease on Wednesday, after the debate, was significantly smaller.\n",
            "\nTrying to allay further economic woes, which could threaten his re-election in November, Trump promised the spread would not last forever -- a claim not directly backed up by health officials.\n",

            "Capitol Hill  -- \nThe Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed an $8.3 billion emergency funding bill to combat the spreading novel coronavirus, sending much-needed aid to embattled states and localities. The vote was 96 to 1.\n",
            "\nThe measure would spend billions of dollars for everything from the research and development of vaccines and therapeutics to the stockpiling of medical supplies and billions to reimburse states and localities, many of whom have been crushed by the expense of battling the virus.\n",
            "\n\u201cToday we face a serious crisis with the spread of the coronavirus. The American people expect us to set aside politics,\u201d said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala. \u201cIn situations like this, no expense should be spared and none was.\u201d",
            "\nThe quick, bipartisan action by the Senate comes on the heels of the House\u2019s swift approval Wednesday with just two Republicans voting against the measure, a rare show of bipartisanship in that chamber.\n",
            "\nIn the Senate, Rand Paul of Kentucky sought unsuccessfully to cut spending on foreign aid in order to pay for the massive funding bill, but the GOP senator, who was alone in voting against final passage, saw just 15 of his fellow Republicans join him in support of his amendment, a sign of the political risk in appearing to oppose the virus funding.",
            "\nThe bill approved Thursday is more than three times what President Donald Trump requested, but lawmakers kept the White House in the loop through a week of intense, behind-the-scenes negotiations which saw a deal come together in near-record time for Congress, and GOP aides close to the matter say they are confident that Trump will sign it.\n",
            "\nThe legislation contains $7.8 billion in new money for federal agencies on the front lines of fighting the virus - the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the State Department, and the Small Business Administration. It allocates $3 billion for the research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, and $1 billion is sent within 30 days to state and local preparedness efforts, with the measure dictating that no state receive less than $4 million. Another $1 billion will go to help the Department of Health and Human Services fort health preparedness efforts, $100 million of which will go directly for community health centers.",
            "\nSeniors in rural areas and others who are at greater risk from the virus can get care at home through Medicare whose providers, under the bill, will now receive roughly $500 million for telehealth services.",
            "\nDemocrats and Republicans clashed over efforts to try to shrink the price of eventual vaccines with Republicans fearful of disincentivizing manufacturers, but Democrats procured $300 million so the federal government can purchase vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, \u201censuring all Americans will have access to the drugs they need to combat coronavirus,\u201d according to a fact sheet shared by the Senate Appropriations panel.\n",
            "\nThe measure rejected a proposal by the Trump administration to take money from Ebola prevention, and it restores some of the cuts made in global health preparedness efforts slashed in the previous two years by President Trump.",
            "\nLawmakers included language that would prohibit the administration from using any of the funding for any other purpose than COVID-19.\n",
            "\n\u201cIf there is a cynical effort by the president to shift funds \u2026 for any reason, it would violate the law,\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said.\n",

Of those, there were an estimated 12,400 deaths in the U.S. The estimated global death rate was very low at 0.02%. This strain continues to circulate as a seasonal flu virus each year, but can be prevented with a flu vaccine.",

While the markets seesaw and daily headlines induce anxiety, experts say everyday investors should keep their gaze focused on the long term.\n",
            "\nMarkets plummeted as trading opened on Monday, enough to trigger a temporary trading halt by the New York Stock Exchange. The 15-minute halt was caused by an automatic circuit breaker safety mechanism that kicked in to prevent a free fall after the S&P 500 plunged by more than 7% within minutes of markets opening.\n",
            "\nMonday's market rout comes after a volatile two weeks: the Dow suffered its worst week since the financial crash of 2008 two weeks ago as fears of a pandemic delivered a massive blow to certain industries and supply chains. Last week, however, hopes of government intervention saw the Dow post its biggest single-day point gain in history on Monday. On Tuesday, the markets plummeted again, and throughout the week the whiplash continued.",
            "\n\"When markets go crazy like this, it is pivotal that investors consider their own time horizon,\" David Bahnsen, the chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group, told ABC News via email.\n",
            "\nIf principal money is needed in one to two years, it should not be in the stock market, he added.\n",
            "\n\"If, on the other hand, the money's use has a longer-term time horizon, investors should let history be their guide about market recovery, the ebbs and flows of market volatility, and most importantly, how downside volatility can help them,\" Bahnsen noted.",
            "\nOver longer periods of time \"a huge percentage of the return an investor will receive from the stock market comes from reinvested dividends,\" he said.\n",
            "\nAs uncomfortable as it may be, downside volatility \"is your friend\" if you are adding new money to your 401(k), reinvesting dividends and maintaining a long term approach, Bahnsen said.\n",
            "\n\"The present volatility is a roller coaster, and roller coasters go up and down,\" he said. \"It will settle in due time, but for now, investors should expect it to continue, and to be a poor environment in which one can make rational and thoughtful decisions.\"",
            "\nIn situations of widespread uncertainty like this, Bahnsen recommends assessing your own personal risk tolerance and diversifying investments.\n",
            "\n\"An intelligent asset allocation that is designed around your risk tolerance and is truly diversified is your best defense against coronavirus market volatility,\" he said. \"And it will be your best defense against the next bout of market volatility as well.\"",
            "\nBankrate's Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick told ABC News that \"to the extent that we are all human, we need to keep in mind that two of the biggest emotions that drive stock prices are greed and fear.\"\n",
            "\n\"The No. 1 job for investors right now is to try and contain fear,\" he said. \"We have to remember that this too shall pass.\"\n",
            "\nHamrick reiterated that now more than ever is the time to focus on the long-term financial goals. For most people who have retirement savings in stock markets, \"that money will not even be utilized for years, if not decades, into the future.\"",
            "\nEven for those closer to retirement, \"the reality is that they have every reason to believe they are going to live long lives,\" he added.\n",
            "\n\"Try to adhere to your long-term financial goals, that means remaining invested in the stock market and continuing to focus on savings and paying down debt,\" he said. \"Because the reality is those are effectively timeless financial goals.\"\n",
            "\n\"Sometimes people view these market down drafts as a true threat, and the reality is that at some point they probably need to get away from some of the information that seems omnipresent these days, and try to focus on the long term,\" Hamrick said.\n",
            "\nThe uncertainty around the coronavirus outbreak and its potential economic impact is causing a \"white-knuckle fear factor among investors,\" analyst Daniel Ives, the managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told ABC News. \"And I think right now that's the biggest overhang on stocks.\"\n",
            "\n\"The Street's worried about earnings coming down and demand being impacted globally, and right now there's more questions than answers from the perspective of investors,\" he added.\n",
            "\nStill, Ives said, \"Right now, I view it more as a short-term shock.\"",
            "\nIves noted that as data points come out from China and elsewhere, \"you're starting to see the stocks reflect the bad news before earnings have been lower,\" he said. \"So, actually what's happening is that the market is pricing in a 10 to 15% cut to earnings across the board, which may or may not happen.\"\n",
            "\n\"In 20 years of covering stocks on Wall Street, this is definitely up there with some of the more nervous I've seen investors, but I don't think the nervousness matches the sell-off I've seen, which isn't warranted,\" he added.\n",
            "\nFor investors who are willing to look past the next six to 12 months, \"I view this as a golden buying opportunity,\" Ives said.",
            "\nThe Wall Street veteran also recommends drowning out the noise as much as possible and staying focused on your financial goals, saying he believes it's \"a negative news cycle and a social media world\" that is scaring investors the most.\n",
            "\n\"In my opinion, the way to handle these situations are stick with the winners and the technology themes for the coming years -- in terms of streamings, cloud computing, cyber security, 5G -- and turn off the television,\" Ives said. \"It's a pause of the tech bull cycle, not the end.\"\n",
            "\nStill, Ives said that investors should gear up for a roller coaster at least in the short term.\n",
            "\n\"I view it more as a buying opportunity for those investors that have a longer-term time horizon,\" he said. \"It's a hand-holding period, but I think right now the bark is a lot worse than the bite.\"\n",
            "\n\"For the average investor, this is going to be a roller coaster over the coming months, and it's one where you need the stomach for the volatility just given what the coronavirus outbreak is creating globally,\" he said. \"If you don't like roller coasters, then you should probably take some chips off the table because it's going to be a pretty volatile ride over the next few weeks.\"",
            "\nHamrick, of Bankrate, noted that there are also opportunities amid the volatility for Americans to ramp up their savings.\n",
            "\n\"There is an opportunity right now that ultimately could help to accelerate savings, and that is that mortgage interest rates have fallen to historic lows,\" he said.\n",
            "\nIn a recent annual Bankrate survey, Hamrick said that American's biggest financial regret has \"consistently been the failure to save for emergencies and the failure to save for retirement.\"\n",
            "\nTimes of economic uncertainty \"really kind of puts that to the test,\" he added. \"Once we get beyond this, we hope that people will remember that.\"\n",
            "\n\"As we like to say, pay yourself first by having an automated direct deposit savings account so we can get through challenges such as temporary unemployment,\" he said. \"You need to have an emergency kit. Think of a savings account as an extension of that.\" \n"

            "\nThe U.S. relies on China for electronics, clothes, toys and, increasingly, prescription drugs. About 90% of the active ingredients used by U.S. companies in drug manufacturing come from China, which has prompted politicians and public health experts to express concern over potential shortages of common generics.\n",
            "\nTo date, manufacturing disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, haven't led to reported shortages in the U.S., but the Food and Drug Administration said it's closely monitoring the situation.\n",

            "\nWessel said although \"hoarding is something we should avoid,\" with most providers, \"it's pretty hard in this day and age to stock up when your insurance company will limit you to a 90-day supply.\"",
            "\nThe coronavirus outbreak has highlighted a \"substantial and potentially threatening reliance on China with our drug supplies,\" Wessel added. \"As production in China has been taken offline, the supplies of those products that go into 90% of the generics Americans take are at risk.\"\n",

            "\nAs coronavirus diagnoses wane, and as more factories in China reopen, potential risks to supply chains also should decline, experts told ABC News.\n",

Redfield did address the fact that certain populations in the United States are being affected more than others.\n",

            "\nSo maybe it's a situation where a more mobile group is able to spread the virus to a less mobile group that's less able to survive it.\n",
            "\nWhatever the reason, for Italy, this attack on the nation's seniors feels to some like an act of war, and so the prime minister's emergency measures had to be equally severe.\n",
            "\nThere was a sense that the virus was outrunning Italians' ability to counter it, that whatever measure came, the virus was two steps ahead. Giuseppe Conte's nationwide quarantine is an effort to get out in front of it -- a move that may seem drastic, but which may also be the only shortcut to limiting the spread.",
            "\nThe real concern now is Italy's health care system -- not many national health services could survive so many elderly people needing intensive care for such a prolonged stretch. Paulo's hope, as ever I often find in a crisis in a foreign country, is that America will help.\n",
            "\nBut the United States, I told him, has its own problems, not least the possibility of facing something even worse if reports are true that tests are not being carried out quickly enough and preventative measures ignored.",

            "\nSome people show up to work no matter what -- snow, hail, sleet or illness. But muscling through is not always the best choice when sick. People are commonly told to stay home when they're sick to avoid spreading their germs.\n",

            "\n\"With the expectation that there will be community spread within the U.S., we need to make preparations to mitigate the spread of the virus,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n",
            "\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is a respiratory illness that is spread primarily from person to person by people who are in close contact with one another (about 6 feet).",
            "\nWhen an infected person sneezes or coughs, the respiratory droplets produced can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. These droplets can then be inhaled and cause infection. Public health officials are still learning about how this novel coronavirus spreads, but they think it might be possible to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface with the virus, and then touching the face. The fact that the virus is so easily transmitted among people in close contact makes self-isolation a very important and effective measure to combat its spread.\n",
            "\nBut how is self-quarantine different from self-isolation?\n",

In both instances, the idea is to stop the spread of the infectious disease.\n",

            "\n\"In the event of a possible exposure to COVID-19, it's vital to impose a self-quarantine at home for the duration of the incubation period,\" currently believed to be 14 days, Glatter said. He said people who feel sick should stay home, closely monitor symptoms and take their temperature twice a day. If people develop new symptoms or a high fever, they should alert their healthcare providers.",
            "\n\"If you are coughing or have a fever, wearing a mask at home will serve as added protection for persons who may live with you at home,\" he said. \"It's also vital to wash your hands frequently to reduce the chance of transmission of the virus. This is the single most important way to protect yourself and others you may live with.\"\n",
            "\nThe CDC recommends consulting with local health departments and health care professions to assess several factors when engaging in self-isolation:\n",
            "\n-Make sure the sick person is stable enough to stay at home\n",
            "\n-Ensure an appropriate caregiver is available to stay with the sick person at home. \n",
            "\n-It's best if the sick person has a separate bedroom to recover, without sharing close space with others. \n",
            "\n-Make sure the sick person has access to food, water and other necessities.\n",
            "\n-Keep in mind that adults over 65, young children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems from autoimmune diseases or chronic heart, lung or kidney conditions are at increased risk of complications from the coronavirus.\n",
            "\n\"The majority of people who get it COVID-19 will be fine,\" Cioe-Pe\u00f1a said.\n",
            "\n\"People are more likely to identify as sick if they are allowed to stay home,\" he said. \"They are less likely to report they are sick if they know they are going to be taken to some isolation unit.\"\n",
            "\nAsking people to self-quarantine is a more effective public health approach than other types of quarantines, like mandatory ones.\n",

If any of these organisms have the ability to cause disease then our greetings can play a role in the transmission from person to person.\"\n",

            "\n\"The culture of kissing is a common form of greeting in some countries.

            "\nThe Centers for Disease Control is issuing new guidance that anyone can be tested for COVID-19 with no restrictions, subject to a doctor's orders, Vice President Mike Pence announced in a briefing with reporters Tuesday evening.\n",
            "\nThe CDC's previous guidance was limited to people who traveled to countries affected by the novel coronavirus outbreaks and came in contact with a diagnosed patient or showed severe symptoms. But Pence said several governors raised concerns that people with only mild symptoms wouldn't be tested.\n",
            "\n\"Today, we will issue new guidance from the CDC that will make it clear that any American can be tested no restrictions, subject to doctors' orders,\" Pence said. \"Several governors said to me that there was an impression that the test would not be administered to people who were only mildly symptomatic. We are issuing new guidance -- effective immediately -- from the CDC that will make it clear that any clinician on health authority can administer the test.\"",
            "\nSenators also raised concerns to public health officials about confusion about who could get tested for exposure, especially Washington Sen. Patty Murray, whose state has announced 9 deaths related to a COVID19 outbreak.",
            "\n\"It's unacceptable that people in my state and nationwide can't even get an answer to whether or not they are infected,\" she said in a hearing with officials from the Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday.\n",
            "\nMurray said residents she's heard from are \"frantically\" calling around to find out how to get tested and that she's concerned there may not be enough tests available.",
            "\nPublic health officials cleared up some of the confusion about COVID-19 testing in Tuesday's hearing with the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Here's what you need to know:\n",
            "\nRight now, state and local public health labs have the capacity to test 15,000 people, according to the FDA, but they are working to rapidly expand the ability to process tests in public and private labs by the end of the week.\n",
            "\nOne company, Integrated DNA Technologies, is manufacturing the COVID-19 test both for CDC to distribute to public health labs and commercially for private and clinical labs. FDA says the company expects to distribute 2,500 test kits by the end of the week, each including 500 tests.\n",
            "\nFDA Commissioner Steven Hahn confirmed Tuesday that the agency expects to have enough test kits distributed by the end of this week to conduct up to 1 million tests. The state and local public health labs will represent up to 75,000 of those tests.\n",
            "\nSen. Murray said the administration knows the 1 million number is misleading and that it doesn't mean that many people will end up being tested.",
            "\n\"Dr. Hahn said that they hope to have a million, but each one of those -- the numbers are hard to follow because they're talking about 2,400 kits and you have to reuse them. \u2026 You have to get tested more than once, so a million people are not going to have a test, even if their most positive, hopeful projection is a million. We need the honest answer to that, so people can plan,\" she told ABC News ahead of Pence's briefing.\n",
            "\nOne problem has been that the initial test kits deployed by the CDC didn't work the way health officials wanted, so states are just now getting access to working tests. Compare that to South Korea: At one point last week, the U.S. had conducted some 3,600 tests total, whereas South Korea was over 70,000, including 10,000 tests in a single day.\n",
            "\nMembers of the coronavirus task force said they will be pushing manufacturers to increase production of testing kits in the coming weeks.\n",
            "\n\"We will see increasing demand and right now we are trying to increase capacity to meet that demand,\" Hahn told reporters Tuesday night.\n",
            "\nYou don't, and your doctor would have to conduct a special test. The symptoms of a cough and fever can be similar for both COVID-19 and the seasonal flu.\n",
            "\nIn coronavirus, the predominant symptoms are what's called a \"lower respiratory\" infection, or an infection in the lungs, said Anthony Fauci, director of National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That's what would cause the cough, along with the fever.\n",
            "\nWith the seasonal flu, symptoms can often start with an \"upper respiratory\" infection -- sneezing and a sore throat with the fever. A lower respiratory infection could develop though too, making it necessary for a doctor to review the symptoms and conduct tests if warranted.",
            "\nMaybe. The ability to detect novel coronavirus requires a specific test, but the test as of early this week hadn't been widely available. That's expected to change later this week but health officials still say that everyone in the general public doesn't automatically need to be tested.\n",
            "\n\"Not everyone needs a test and we don't want to go through all our tests on low risk situations and not be able to really address that care and the contacts that are going to be critical,\" Schuchat testified on Tuesday.",
            "\nCDC guidance to health care professionals specifies that a patient should be tested for COVID-19 if they traveled to an affected area like Wuhan, China, or some parts of Italy in the last 14 days, came in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient in the last 14 days, or have symptoms like fever and lower respiratory illness that can't be attributed to another diagnosis like the flu.\n",
            "\nHealth officials say people should not wear masks if they are not sick and are not in contact with someone who is infected.\n",
            "\nMasks and other equipment should be prioritized for health care workers who wear masks because they know they are in close contact with people who are sick. But experts say it's not necessary for a person in a regular setting, and that the best thing they can do to prevent exposure to both the flu and COVID-19 is wash hands for 20 seconds, not touch their face and disinfect surfaces.\n",
            "\nAnd if you do exhibit symptoms, the best advice is to stay home.\n",
            "\nThe World Health Organization hasn't labeled it a global \"pandemic\" yet, although U.S. officials on Tuesday predicted that was possible as it spreads from country to country.\n",
            "\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said that label wouldn't change what the U.S. is doing to address the matter.\n",
            "\nThere's a lot U.S. officials don't know about coronavirus just yet. But health officials say they suspect, based on data from China, that children under 15 represented very few cases compared to adults.\n",
            "\nFauci said the mean age of a patient was about 50. He also said the primary concern is how older patients and people with underlying health conditions will fare if struck with the virus.\n",
            "\nA vaccine is still 12 to 18 months away. However, researchers are also focused on treatment therapies that might improve symptoms. And unlike the vaccine, a therapy for coronavirus is possible much sooner with one drug already being closely looked at.\n",
            "\n\"We should know within a period of a few months -- several months -- whether or not this particular drug works,\" Fauci said. \"If it does, the implementation of that would be almost immediate.\"              \n"

            "\nDavid Ropeik, author of \u201cHow Risky Is It Really?\u201d and speaker on risk perception and communication, spoke to ABC\u2019s Cheri Preston, about the consequences of worrying too much.\n",
            "\n\u201cWhen a risk is new, it has uncertainty. We don't know yet what we need to know to protect ourselves, and that uncertainty makes us feel powerless, like we don't have control over it,\u201d Ropeik said. From canceled flights and events, sold out cleaning supplies, to drastically fluctuating stock markets, it\u2019s safe to say people are nervous. \u201cSo what we do is anything that gives us a sense of control, like we buy all the bottled water and toilet paper at Costco \u2026 but in part it's because we're freaking out rather than it's actually just good practice,\u201d Ropeik continued.",
            "\nFear of the unknown worries people just as much as the virus. While trying to take control of the situation -- whether that means self-quarantining, buying all the toilet paper at the supermarket or stocking up on canned goods -- can give people a sense of control, it\u2019s better to be cautious, aware and keep matters in perspective.\n",
            "\nRather than panic, it\u2019s suggested to do research on ways to prevent the virus from spreading more and what to watch out for by visiting the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) or World Health Organization\u2019 (WHO) website.\n",
            "\nABC\u2019s own Dr. Jen Ashton has also been answering hundreds of questions about COVID-19 for those who are looking for a better understanding of the virus, including what precautions to take.\n",
            "\n\u201cWe're in this fear state, but the fear state turns down the immune system. When you spread fear to your friends, it's almost like spreading germs to them. You wouldn't want people to do that to you. We shouldn't do that to other people,\u201d said Ropeik.\n",

            "\nReading the latest news on coronavirus once daily will keep you informed without constantly thinking about the virus and knowing every detail.",
            "\n\"The more you check your phone and are thinking about coronavirus, the more your brain has new data points and is changing the estimate of how likely it is,\" added Abigail Marsh, professor of psychology at Georgetown University and author of \"The Fear Factor: How One Emotion Connects Altruists, Psychopaths, and Everyone In-Between.\" \"You end up with a false perception of the future.\"\n",
            "\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the general public to take \"everyday preventive actions\" to help stop the spread of germs, including getting a flu vaccine, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, staying home when sick and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.\n",
            "\nFurther precautions -- including avoiding crowds and stocking up on supplies -- are recommended only for older people and people with severe chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and lung disease.\n",

            "\n\"It's those actions that are excessive that are just meant to reduce our anxiety in the short-term,\" he said. \"And they may, but they actually prevent us from learning how to manage our anxiety about this in the long term.\"",
            "\nIf you find your mind wandering to worst-case scenarios or unknowns, Puliafico says to focus on the scientific evidence of where the coronavirus stands now in the U.S.\n",
            "\nInstead of scanning Twitter, for example, check the most recent statistics from the CDC, or speak to your doctor.\n",
            "\n\"When we're anxious, we tend to over-focus on the most dangerous components of a situation, whether that be the people who are seriously ill or where coronavirus is spreading to new areas, and we don't take in all of the other information,\" he said. \"We don't necessarily focus on the fact that most cases of coronavirus are mild, or that many people are living around coronavirus and not contracting it.\"\n",
            "\nIf there are low-risk steps you can take that would ease your anxiety and be useful, go ahead and take them, advises Dr. Jen Ashton, ABC News chief medical correspondent.

            "\n\"I am still going about my day-to-day life with some common sense precautions,\" she said. \"We can\u2019t shut down the way we live but I think we can increase our awareness and take steps that don\u2019t dramatically affect what we\u2019re doing but, again, are low risk and may have some benefit.\"\n",
            "\n\"It\u2019s a matter of taking low risk steps that you personally can take and not only could it help, it\u2019ll probably alleviate some anxiety too,\" Ashton added.",
            "\nMost if not all of the precautions for the coronavirus -- like washing your hands and staying home if you're sick -- are designed to help stop the spread of the virus and to keep the most vulnerable people healthy.\n",
            "\nThink about helping other people when you find your mind rushing with anxiety, recommends Marsh.\n",
            "\n\"The people that I know who are the most anxious are the people themselves who are not at high-risk, which is most of the population,\" she said. \"Make sure you\u2019re re-framing the nature of the risk as focusing on protecting other people.\"\n",
            "\nIf you are anxiously washing your hands all day to protect yourself, Marsh says to re-frame your thinking to say, \"I\u2019m keeping the people around me safe and keeping my community safe.\"",
            "\nIf you are a parent worried about your child's health in public settings, focus on the fact that kids are less vulnerable than older adults, so guidelines and recommendations have less to do the need to protect children than spreading the virus to other people.\n"

            "\n\"The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American,'\" Trump tweeted Monday morning before the markets opened.",
            "\nLater, about an hour after the markets plunged, Trump continued to engage in a confused narrative about the crisis, downplaying the situation and often putting him at odds with the messaging that his own health experts are trying to get across.\n",
            "\nTune into ABC News Live at noon EDT every weekday for the latest news, context and analysis on the novel coronavirus, with the full ABC News team where we will try to answer your questions about the virus.\n",
            "\n\"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!,\" the president tweeted, appearing to attempt to calm fears as the global markets plummeted.",
            "\nLess than 10 minutes before Trump tweeted that \"the economy will go on,\" and characterized the coronavirus as less dangerous than the common flu, Health and Human Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News, \"Make no mistake, this is a very serious health problem. Nobody is trying to minimize that. It is a very serious public health threat to the people of the United States.\"\n",
            "\n\"President Trump is leading a whole of government response with the vice president helping him on the public health issues we're facing with the novel coronavirus. That is his number one concern in terms of the economy. He and his economic team have the tools to keep this economy going strong,\" Azar then told reporters at the White House Monday. \"But the public heath and protecting the American people is the number one priority for all of us.\"\n",
            "\nTrump also added that closing the U.S. borders to China travel was the \"BEST decision\" -- although since that action weeks ago -- cases of community transmission -- person to person inside the United States -- not connected to China -- continue to rise.",

            "\nFollowing a closed White House meeting, Trump and the coronavirus task force held a press briefing late Monday evening to lay out a new pitch to Congress and the latest on the virus' economic impact.\n",
            "\nThe president announced that he and his administration will propose a \"possible\" payroll tax cut as well as assistance for hourly wage earners.\n",
            "\n\"We are going to be asking tomorrow -- we're seeing the Senate, going to be meeting with House Republicans, Mitch McConnell, everybody -- and discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief -- very substantial relief -- that's a big number,\" he said. \"We're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they're not going to ever miss a paycheck.\"\n",
            "\nAfter the Dow dropped more than 2,000 points, Trump also promised a small business loan program and vowed to help those industries hardest hit.",
            "\n\"We're also working with the industries including the airline industry, the cruise ship industry -- which obviously will be hit. We're working with them very, very strongly,\" the president said. \"We're also talking to the hotel industry and some places actually will do well and some places probably won't do well at all but we're working also with the hotel industry. But the main thing is that we're taking care of the American public and we will be taking care of the American public.\"\n",

            "\nOver the weekend, while reported U.S. cases increased to more than 550 with at least 22 deaths in the U.S. across at least 34 states, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams claimed that the virus was being contained in some areas, comparing it to a seasonal flu.\n",
            "\n\"If we had massive numbers of cases we would be seeing more deaths. And so we actually feel pretty good that some parts of the country have contained it just like when you look at the flu,\" Adams said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday. \"When we look at the flu tracker, some parts of the country are having much more severe flu seasons. Some are having very mild flu seasons. The same thing for coronavirus.\"\n",
            "\nWhen asked if Trump or Democratic candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, -- all in their 70s and technically higher risk -- should stop traveling or holding rallies in light of the outbreak, Adams downplayed the threat to the president, saying Trump has been washing his hands frequently.\n",
            "\n\"But speaking of being at risk, the president, he sleeps less than I do and he's healthier than what I am,\" Adams, who is in his mid-40s, said.",
            "\nAdams walked back his comments on Twitter Monday morning, calling it an \"inelegant comparison.\"\n",
            "\n\"I should not have made this comparison. I was wrong,\" Adams said. \"What's most concerning is we need to get information out to the American people about coronavirus, but some would rather focus on my inelegant comparison versus the info about who is at risk for coronavirus -- which was the most important part of the interview.\"\n",
            "\nTrump admin walks back president's comments at CDC\n",
            "\nThe administration continued to send contradictory signals over the weekend about its response to the coronavirus, after Trump claimed during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday that \"anyone who wants a test can get a test.\"",
            "\n\"As of right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test (can have one), that's the important thing, and the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect, the transcription was perfect,\" Trump said, seeming to clap back to his phone call with the president of Ukraine that triggered his impeachment. \"They have the tests and the tests are beautiful.\"\n",
            "\nTrump added that the government's testing capacity is \"amazing,\" but that notion has been widely disputed by scientists and health officials who have expressed alarm over the speed with which the CDC has tested and over the quality of its tests.\n",
            "\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar appeared to walk back the president's comments Saturday, cautioning that everyone will not be automatically approved for a test.\n",
            "\n\"You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test,\" Azar said at an off-camera briefing at the White House. \"That is our medical system in the United States, in the same way that you may not get a cardiac medicine if your doctor doesn't prescribe that.\"\n",
            "\nA growing list of lawmakers self-quarantining themselves\n",
            "\nWhen Trump was asked Saturday about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House, the president said, \"I'm not concerned at all.\"\n",

Ted Cruz and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz -- announced they would self-quarantine after they interacted briefly with a person infected by the novel coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland late February. Rep. Louie Gohmert was also in contact with the CPAC attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, but was on Capitol Hill Monday after he said a CDC doctor informed him that he shouldn't be at any risk.\n",
            "\nGaetz and Collins were in Florida with the president over the weekend.",
            "\nDespite concerns that administration officials were exposed to COVID-19 at CPAC in Maryland late February, senior White House sources told ABC News that Trump and his closest advisers have not been tested for coronavirus.\n",
            "\nAt a press briefing Monday afternoon Vice President Mike Pence said he hadn't been tested and late Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement confirming that Trump had not been tested either.\n",
            "\n\"The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms. President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,\" according to the statement. \"Per current CDC guidelines, medical professionals should base testing decisions on patient symptoms and exposure history.\"\n",
            "\nSeparately, Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., closed her Washington office for the week and was remaining at home after meeting with someone who tested positive for the new coronavirus. In a statement, she said she is not experiencing any symptoms.\n",

            "\n\"These are additional. This is about the families. We're about putting families first. If your children's school is closed, who's going to take care of them at home? If kids are dependent on food at school, how are they going to have food security?\u201d She said. \"So addresses some of those things, paid family leave -- for the purpose of the coronavirus, unemployment insurance in case your company just folds, although we had in our bill SBA loans for helping to sustain a workforce\" Pelosi said.\n",
            "\n\"So it's about how we protect the families and how we protect the workers, the health care providers and the rest in the atmospheres in which they're working,\u201d she continued.\n",
            "\nPelosi also stressed that any decision to close the Capitol due to concerns over coronavirus will be based on science.\n",
            "\n\"At this time there is no reason to do so, but it's not my decision. It's a security and the health decision and we'll be depending on the experts\" she said.",

            "\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he doubted the U.S. would have to impose measures as \"draconian\" as total shutdowns ordered in regions in northern Italy to halt the spread of coronavirus but admitted that \"anything is possible.\"\n",
            "\n\"We have to be realistic. I don't think it would be as draconian as nobody in or nobody out. But if we continue to get cases like this, particularly at the community level, there will be what we call 'mitigation,' where we have to essentially do social distancing, keep people out of crowded places, take a look at seriousness, do you really need to travel, and I think it's particularly important among the most vulnerable,\" Fauci said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n",
            "\n\"You don't want to alarm people, but given the spread we've seen anything is possible and that's why we've got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak,\" he added.\n",

            "\nThe emergence of the coronavirus as a world health epidemic and fears of it spreading have halted air and ground travel in some regions of the world and stalled it elsewhere, significantly reducing the amount of carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere.\n",
            "\nPollution monitoring satellites from NASA and the European Space Agency have detected significant decreases of nitrogen dioxide over China since Jan. 1, following the outbreak of the virus -- evidence that the noxious gas being emitted by motor vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities has nearly come to a complete stop.",
            "\nAnd China isn't the only part of the world where emissions from travel have slowed down. Almost every U.S. air carrier has suspended international flights to affected areas and has issued traveled waives for passengers who have flights booked in the coming months. In addition, global air traffic decreased by 4.3% in February amid the COVID-19 outbreak, aircraft flight traffic website FlightRadar24 announced on Tuesday.\n",
            "\nThe question is: Is the reduction in emissions enough to mitigate climate change and the environmental dangers that come with it? According to experts, the answer is no.",
            "\nScientists can find similar reductions in emissions in other points of history where economic slowdowns occurred, such as World War II and the Great Recession, Richard Alley, a geosciences professor at Penn State University who specializes in climate change, told ABC News.\n",
            "\nEvents such as those have \"made tweaks\" in emissions, but they haven't changed the overall upward trend, Alley said.\n",

            "\nIn fact, if there were a major change in the world's economy enough to make a difference in climate change, the world's population would have much more immediate problems to worry about than a climate crisis in the next 100 years, such as whether people could work and buy food, Alley said.",
            "\nPeople may be mistaken if they feel like a temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions is good for the environment, Andrea Dutton, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told ABC News.\n",

            "\nPresident Donald Trump's announcement that Vice President Mike Pence has the experience to lead the administration's coronavirus response has raised questions around Pence's handling of a major health crisis when he was governor of Indiana.\n",
            "\n\"He\u2019s got a certain talent for this,\" Trump said at Wednesday's White House briefing as he sought to reassure the public on how the White House is dealing with the virus, which has infected at least 60 Americans so far.",
            "\nOthers, however, have criticized Pence's response to the state's worst outbreak of HIV in its history and the nation's first HIV outbreak linked to the injection of oral painkillers while he was Indiana's governor in 2015. The crisis began when people started injecting a liquid form of a potent painkiller multiple times a day and sharing needles.\n",
            "\nWhile health officials advocated for a clean-needle exchange to slow the spread of infection, Pence staunchly opposed the program on grounds it could encourage or support drug abuse.\n",
            "\n\"I don\u2019t believe effective anti-drug policy involves handing out drug paraphernalia,\" Pence said at the time. \"I don't believe that effective anti-drug policy involves handing out paraphernalia to drug users by government officials.\"\n",
            "\nIt wasn't until two months after the outbreak was detected -- and at least 75 people were confirmed HIV-positive -- that Pence declared a state of emergency. He announced he'd allow a needle exchange program for 30 days but added that if the legislature sent him a broader needle exchange program bill, he would veto it.\n",
            "\nThe outbreak highlighted the weaknesses in Indiana's health infrastructure as it placed 41st nationally in America's health rankings.",
            "\nStudies in medical journals have said the epidemic could have been prevented if the state had acted faster.\n",
            "\nAfter conducting a 2018 Yale University study on the outbreak, researcher and associate professor, Forrest W. Crawford, said: \"Our findings suggest that with earlier action the actual number of infections recorded in Scott County -- 215 -- might have been brought down to fewer than 56, if the state had acted in 2013, or to fewer than 10 infections, if they had responded to the [hepatitis C] outbreak in 2010-2011.\"\n",
            "\n\"Instead they cut funding for the last HIV testing provider in the county,\" Crawford added.",
            "\nSince a Planned Parenthood clinic in the Scott County -- where the outbreak originated -- had closed in 2013, free HIV testing wasn't available in the area. Pence, as a member of Congress, voted to cut Planned Parenthood funding in 2011.\n",
            "\nWhile there is no direct link between the closure and the outbreak, had a center provided HIV tests in Scott County, workers could have reported positive results to the state.\n",
            "\nBut Dr. Jerome Adams, Pence\u2019s health commissioner at the time who now serves as U.S. Surgeon General, defended the governor, saying he needed certainty that he was doing the right thing.\n",
            "\n\"The governor wanted to make sure if we went this route it was absolutely necessary,\" Dr. Adams said at the time. \"I believe he was praying on it up until the final decision.\"",
            "\nCritics, however, say that Pence's track record does not qualify him to lead a national health crisis.",
            "\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday morning on Capitol Hill that she spoke with the vice president and expressed her concerns of him holding the position.\n",
            "\n\"While I look forward to working with him,\" she said, \"while he was governor of Indiana, slashing the public health budget and having some clinics, especially a Planned Parenthood close, which was the only place in that Scott County where you could get tested for HIV and AIDS. There was an outbreak. Again, he will have his side of the story.\"\n",
            "\n\"This is about resources. It's also personnel. It's also about respect for science and evidence-based decision making,\" she added.\n",
            "\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took to Twitter Wednesday evening, calling Trump's plan to have Pence lead the response \"disgusting,\" adding that Pence \"wanted to 'pray away' HIV epidemic.\"",
            "\nLeana Wen, the past head of Planned Parenthood, also tweeted Wednesday: \"As Governor of Indiana, an HIV/AIDS epidemic flourished until he allowed public health -- not ideology -- to direct policy & response.\"\n",
            "\nA different researcher on the 2018 Yale University study said in a tweet that Pence's slow response \"fueled an HIV outbreak in his state.\" Noting that Pence is not a doctor or scientist, Trump \"made the choice of putting someone absolutely not up to the task to this crucial position. It endangers us all. This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue,\" Greg Gonsalves tweeted.\n",
            "\nIt's not the only public health issue on which Pence is facing criticism.\n",
            "\nAs late as 2000, Pence also downplayed the risk of smoking, as evident by an op-ed, unearthed by Vox, on his congressional website: \"Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\"",
            "\nAt Wednesday's briefing, Trump emphasized that Pence would not be a coronavirus \"czar\" as \"he is a part of the administration,\" but he is expected to be the face of the response.\n",
            "\nWhile some have speculated that the move to appoint Pence is a blow to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Azar called the move \"genius\" in a hearing on Capitol Hill on Thursday.\n",

Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., if the coronavirus task force will follow the advice of medical experts, citing what he called Pence's \"slow walk\" in responding to the 2015 HIV outbreak in his state.\n",
            "\n\"As you know, one of the largest outbreaks of another virus, HIV, occurred in Indiana. It was the result of critical testing sites and clinics being closed due to cuts to state funding. When it was determined that the cases were spiking due to needle sharing, then Governor Pence failed to heed the advice of medical experts. He really did slow walk the needed public health response,\" Panetta said. \"Can you assure us, Mr. Secretary, that HHS will follow the advice of leading medical experts and not delay implementation?\"\n",

            "\nDr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, says our understanding of the disease is still developing and the statistics are preliminary.\n",
            "\n\u201cThey\u2019re all estimates,\" he said. \"What are you counting as a case in your particular country? ... That case definition has varied a lot.\u201d\n",

            "\nWhile some studies peg the death rate to 3.4%, experts expect to see this rate decrease as the health care system starts finding milder cases.\n",
            "\n\u201cWhat I was able to find by looking at a few other data sources, rather than just the big flashy numbers, was that there\u2019s actually a lot of reason to be reassured that the numbers are a lot lower,\u201d said Faust.",
            "\nBecause only the sickest people are showing up at hospitals, this group is likely over-represented among the full population of people who have COVID-19, according to  Faust. Most COVID-19 cases are mild, and many individuals will never even see a health care provider to be tested.\n",
            "\n\u201cIf you get to people over 70, we\u2019re going to have much higher fatality rates. And I\u2019ve seen some estimates of even as high as 10%, which would be huge for people 70 and older,\u201d said Schaffner. \u201cBut remember, those people accumulate a whole lot of underlying illnesses, which adds to their risk. They have heart disease, diabetes, lung disease ... Some of these people, particularly from China, have lived in polluted environments their whole life. Some of the men, especially, have been lifetime smokers. So they are at very increased risk of severe disease.\u201d",
            "\nThe recent quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan might provide a greater insight into the age-specific nature of COVID-19\u2019s mortality rate, according to Faust.\n",
            "\n\u201cIf you had an outbreak on a cruise ship, and there\u2019s any sign that care was delayed or that people who really should\u2019ve been protected weren\u2019t, then you actually have reason to say \u2018Oh, actually, whatever we found on the cruise ship, it\u2019s actually that\u2019s the worst case scenario because they didn\u2019t get treatment on time.\u2019\u201d",
            "\nOf the 705 passengers who tested positive for the virus on the Diamond Princess, six died -- which is a death rate of less than 1%. All of the patients who died onboard were more than 70 years old.\n",
            "\n\u201cIn China, about 12% of cases were in the elderly,\" said Faust. \"On the Diamond Princess, four times that many older people had the disease. So again, if you\u2019re trying to figure out what this means for the entire population, it might even mean that the overall fatality rate would be lower.\"",
            "\nRight now, death rate estimates vary per country. The best estimates for South Korea put COVID-19's fatality rate at 0.6%, and a recent study released on the death the rate in China -- but outside hard-hit Wuhan -- hovered just above that, at 0.7%.\n",
            "\nRight now, the best experts can say is that COVID-19 is probably more deadly that the seasonal flu, but much less deadly than other high profile outbreaks like Ebola, SARS, and MERS, with death rates of 50%, 10%, and 35%, respectively. The Center for Disease Control is planning to set up a national surveillance reporting system in 8 to 12 weeks, which will help to establish a more reliable mortality rate.\n",
            "\n\u201cThere\u2019s a large epidemic of coronavirus anxiety,\u201d said Schaffner. \"I think [people] ought to take a deep breath and spend a little more time planning what to do if the coronavirus really came into their community and they had to undergo what we call social distancing, which is separating themselves from other people. If you do this now when you\u2019re more calm, it works much better when you really have to apply it rather than planning in a more anxious moment later on.\u201d\n",
