            "BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Global experts have argued against imposing travel restrictions on China during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), saying such measures are groundless, ineffective and against humanity.",
            "The argument has been seconded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and institutions in dozens of countries, which have simultaneously called for international cooperation to support China and fight the COVID-19.",
            "CALLS FOR EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS",
            "In a paper published last week on British medical journal The Lancet, scholars argued that imposing travel bans on China is a flagrant violation of the International Health Regulations (IHR).",
            "The IHR governs how 196 countries and WHO collectively address the global spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade, stipulating that the measures countries implement when addressing public health risks need to be supported by science, commensurate with the risks involved and anchored in human rights.",
            "Citing Article 43 of the regulations, the paper, written by 16 scholars and supported by research institutions in Canada, Britain, the United States, Norway, Switzerland, Italy and so on, argued that the travel restrictions against China are not supported by science, ineffective, and, most importantly, disregarding the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons.",
            "The WHO has said there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. Addressing the 146th session of the WHO Executive Board meeting earlier this month, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.",
            "Tedros's advise has been echoed by his predecessor Margaret Chan. \"WHO has declared that all countries shall not impose travel or trade restrictions on China. And this is also the spirit of international health regulations valued by the WHO,\" the former director-general has said.",
            "COOPERATION RATHER THAN RESTRICTION",
            "At a time when many countries have put travel restrictions on China, world experts have voiced support for China and stressed that global cooperation rather than restriction is essential to overcoming the COVID-19 outbreak.",
            "\"Such outbreaks can happen in any parts of the world. Rather than giving pressure to China or suspending the flights and imposing travel bans, the international community should help and cooperate with it in this crisis period,\" said Sundarnath Bhattarai, acting chairman of China Study Center-Nepal.",
            "Jennifer Nuzzo, associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the United States should re-examine its approach to the virus crisis, including travel restrictions and suspension of flights.",
            "These measures are inconsistent with the advice of the WHO, and unlikely to be effective in stopping the virus from entering the country; instead they will take a toll on the economy and trade, said Nuzzo.",
            "Following a special meeting in Brussels on Thursday, European Union Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the EU is not considering banning Chinese travelers from entering its visa-free Schengen area at the moment, and people should have faith in the measures being taken by member states and China to contain the virus.",
            "In Africa, director for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) John Nkengasong said the African CDC is currently coordinating with China to address the novel coronavirus outbreak and warned against baseless fearmongering.",
            "\"WHO has made it clear there should be no restriction on flights to, in and out of China, and we adhere to the WHO advisory,\" he said.",

On March 9, the Seattle-area nursing home at the epicenter of the US COVID-19 outbreak said it had no kits to test 65 employees who were showing symptoms of the virus that has killed at least 13 patients at the long-term care center.",

Though University of Washington has already offered to process tests, it is still unclear why the nursing staff have yet to receive kits.",

It is hard to believe that a superpower like the US has a shortage of test kits and is not able to test enough people for the coronavirus, causing a public outcry.",

            "The peoples war against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is entering a decisive stage in China. Under the strong leadership of the central government, the whole nation has devoted tremendous amounts of resources and efforts to this war. The prevention and control of the epidemic in Hubei, especially in such heavily-hit areas as Wuhan, has become a key campaign; and the measures taken by other Chinese regions will determine whether this war will turn to be a war of attrition or a protracted war. For now, a few questions remain for the international community concerned about how soon China will totally conquer the coronavirus: When will be the turning point of the epidemic? What new measurers and efforts have the Chinese government and people taken to fight against the epidemic and with what effects? What new progresses have been made by the Chinese medical community in epidemic control and treatment to COVID-19 patients? And what lessons can be learned by the international public health circles from this war against an epidemic of even greater impact than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003? This report gives latest answers to those questions from a special research team at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS).",
            "The reports concludes that at present, the COVID-19 epidemic manifests a trend of localized clusters of outbreak (especially in the City of Wuhan and some other areas in Hubei Province) but coming increasingly in check in other parts of China. The situation in Hubei, Wuhan and other regions is expected to be further improved with enhanced national strategy and measures. Nevertheless, the turning point of the epidemic will depend on the effectiveness of the current prevention and control measures, as well as cooperation of the general public. In the next week or two, China will be faced by new challenges as millions of people return to work in major cities after the Spring Festival. If the number of new infections can be kept low for two weeks, then we can say the turning point has come in China except for Hubei.",
            "This report points out that although there is still no direct cure for COVID-19, Chinas government branch in charge of epidemic prevention, medical institutions and medical researchers have joined hands in optimizing the epidemic control strategy and patient treatment plans. It proves increasingly effective to detecting, confirming, and treating infected people at the earliest time, as well as to rescuing severely ill patients and reducing mortality rates.",
            "It is also pointed out that Chinas whole-of-government approach and efficient social mobilization system are the basic guarantee for victory of the peoples war. The many unconventional measures adopted so far -- such as rushing medical staff and other resources to Wuhan from around China, assigning 19 provinces or municipalities to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei, instituting workfrom-home arrangements, and calling for the public to stay home unless necessary -- all will help China to win the war against the epidemic.",
            "As this report believes in the end, Chinas ongoing peoples war against COVID19 epidemic can lend many lessons and inspirations to the international community for combating pandemics in the future. In the globalized era, the world is yet to be ready for pandemics breaking out in mega-cities. How to strengthen the response capabilities of local public health systems in face of an epidemic? How to gather and coordinate various resources of a nation for effective epidemic prevention and control? And how to enhance the sense of a community of shared future for mankind and reinforce joint efforts of the international community against a pandemic? The key to those questions lies in solidarity of the nation, scientific prevention and control measures, and strengthened international cooperation. I firmly believe this peoples war against the epidemic will give much enlightenment to both China and the international community.",
            "China's Fight Against COVID-19 Epidemic: A Decisive Campaign",
            "China is arriving at a critical moment in the war against novel coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19). According to statistics, although the absolute number of confirmed diagnoses is still increasing, its growth rate has begun to show a downturn in China except for Wuhan and a few other areas in Hubei province. Through joint efforts of the whole nation, Chinas highest-level prevention and control measures have proven quite effective, with the spread of the virus slowing down and the diagnosis and cure rates on a steady rise. Thanks to timely adjustments of the national strategy and measures in epidemic control, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on Wuhan, Hubei, and elsewhere in China has been increasingly contained: on one hand, the unceasing inflow of various national resources is ushering in a turning point in the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan and Hubei; on the other hand, imported infections and subsequent spread of the virus in other regions have been under ever tighter control as a result of strengthened measures targeted at the local situations.",
            "",
            "At present, the Chinese government and society are sparing no effort to win the war against the epidemic: rushing medical staff and other resources to Wuhan from around China, assigning 19 provinces or municipalities to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei, legislating for scientific prevention and control of the epidemic by the Peoples Congress in many places, instituting work-from-home arrangements, mustering intelligence support from internet companies, and calling for the public to stay home unless necessary. All these unconventional moves are helping China to win the race with time.",
            "",
            "Chinas Prevention and Control Measures Are Taking Effect",
            "First, statistics have shown that the epidemic has been kept in check. Nationwide, except for Hubei province, the growth rates of confirmed infections, suspected cases, and patients under medical observation are all a steady decline. To be more specific, newly confirmed cases in places other than Hubei had decreased, for eight days in a row, from 890 on February 3 to 312 on February 12. On February 12, according to the fifth edition of Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus Diagnosis and Treatment, Hubei health authorities counted clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed, which resulted in a",
            "sharp increase in new confirmed cases. This broadened diagnosis criteria further reflects Chinas enhanced diagnostic capacity and the principle of leaving no one unattended or under-attended. (Figure 1)",
            "",
            "",
            "Nationwide, the spread of the deadly virus has been effectively curbed. Although the adoption of a new diagnosis criteria resulted in a sharp increase in reported newinfections and death toll on February 12 alone, the growth rates of both categories were lower than those during the peak moment. The growth rate of confirmed cases decreased from 64.54% on January 27 to 33.93% on February 12; that of COVID-19- associated deaths decreased from the peak of 64% on January 24 to 22.82% on February 12. Moreover, suspected cases and patients under medical observation were also on the decline. Suspected cases registered a negative growth rate of -16.38% on February 12 compared with 173.77% on January 23, while the growth rate of patients under medical observation decreased from as high as 253.52% on January 22 to a negative rate of - 1.97% on February 12. (Figure 2)",
            "",
            "Second, the epicenter of the epidemic has been confined to such areas as Wuhan, Xiaogan, and Huanggang in Hubei, while the confirmed cases in other regions in China are relatively few and mainly imported ones. On the whole, Hubei has witnessed the majority of confirmed cases, severe cases and COVID-19-associated deaths in China. As Figure 3 shows, between January 20 and February 12, COVID-19-associated deaths in Hubei were 95% of the national number (1,310 out of 1,368); severe cases in Hubei were 88% (7,084 out of 8,030); and confirmed cases in Hubei were 80% (48,206 out of 59,804). After the peak of imported cases, other regions in China have had no new outbreak thanks to the strong prevention and control measures nationwide.",
            "",
            "Third, the growth of severe cases around China is slowing down and the rehabilitation rate has surpassed the death rate. As a key indicator to the severity and fatality of the epidemic, severe cases have been under most meticulous treatment and with utmost care. As a result, the death rate had dropped from over 100% on January 20 to a negative rate of -2.17% on February 12.(Figure 4)",
            "",
            "Fourth, the COVID-19-caused mortality rate is on a steady decline. As shown by the daily ratio between accumulated deaths and severe cases, the mortality rate has been decreasing significantly in Hubei (from 40% on January 25 to 18.49% on February 12) and remains low (well below 10%) in other regions of China (Figure 5).",
            "",
            "Fifth, with deeper understanding of the coronavirus and enhanced effectiveness of medical treatment, the number of cured patients has kept rising -- from 34 by January 23 to 5,911 by February 12 nationwide. Besides, the number of cured patients has begun to exceed that of COVID-19-caused deaths since February 1, with 24 more cured cases on February 1 to 4544 on February 12 (Figure 6). In Shandong, Zhejiang and a few other provinces, the number of cured patients has even begun to surpass that of confirmed cases.",
            "",
            "The war against COVID-19 epidemic has come to a critical moment. Currently, there are two major views on when the turning point will be. Prudent optimists think that it will come sometime between February 10 to 15, right after Chinas Lantern Festival. According to Professor Zhong Nanshan, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, director of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, and head of the High-level Panel of Experts, the latent period of the novel coronavirus is usually 3 to 7 days and 24 days at maximum. With the nationwide restrictions on population flow, both the peak and turning point of the epidemic will appear around the Lantern Festival.2 On this trend, the epidemic may be over by the end of April.",
            "Pessimists, however, predict that the turning point will come as late as April, with confirmed cases surpassing 70,000. For instance, a research done by Professor Joseph T. Wus team at the School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong University, published on The Lancet on January 31, forecast the turning point of the epidemic to appear in April based on latest mathematical modelling. Meanwhile, the research points out that [t]o possibly succeed, substantial, even draconian measures that limit population mobility should be seriously and immediately considered in affected areas, as should strategies to drastically reduce within-population contact rates through cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and instituting work-fromhome arrangements, for example.Now that all the recommended measures have been adopted, the gloomy forecast is not quite likely to become reality.",
            "",
            "In fact, the turning point of the epidemic not only depends on the objective laws of the development of the novel coronavirus, but it is also a function of the collective efforts of the Chinese government and people. As Professor Chen Wei, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering and researcher at the Institute of Military Medical Sciences of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, warns, although the turning point is coming soon, the possibility of recurring of the epidemic still remains, and thus it is necessary to plan for the worst and make fullest preparation for long-term fight against it. In the same vein, Mr. Zhang Wenhong, director of the Department for Infectious Diseases at Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and a member of the Shanghai special medical team for COVID-19, calls for support from the general public, saying that staying home and refraining from going out is also a contribution to our fight [against the epidemic].",
            "Therefore, it is believed that despite the positive progresses in prevention and control of the novel coronavirus, the turning point of the epidemic will be determined by further endeavor of the Chinese government and people. China is facing new challenges especially in the next one to two weeks, as millions of people from all over the country are returning to work in mega-cities after the Spring Festival. If the number of new infections remains low two weeks later, it can be said that the turning point has come except for Hubei.",
            "",
            "In general, strong epidemic control, effective medical treatment to COVID-19 patients, and enhancing rehabilitation rate are three interrelated key missions of Chinas war against the epidemic. Only when all of them are achieved, can China win the war in the shortest time.",
            "Above all, a decrease of new confirmed and suspected cases will be the most direct indicator of the turning point and a clear proof of the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures. At present, despite the increase of the absolute number of new confirmed and suspected cases, its growth rate has been on the decline for days. If such trend continues for another week or two, then the first mission will be accomplished.",
            "Next, as the biggest threat to public health, severe cases and COVID-19-caused deaths are the main roots of public fear of the epidemic. A decreasing number of severe cases and deaths will indicate that the medical treatment is taking effect and that the severity of the epidemic is in check. Up to now, the mortality rate of COVID-19 has remained rather low except in Hubei, which means the epidemic has been under tight control in most Chinese regions. After classified treatment and a greater number of intensive care unit (ICU) facilities are introduced in Hubei, the mortality rate there is expected to shrink as well.",
            "Finally, the ultimate victory will be achieved when all COVID-19 patients are cured. Now, the rehabilitation rate is increasing steadily with enhanced measures and capabilities of medical treatment, while the public has developed more understanding about COVID-19 and strengthened self-protection. Both will help reduce the number of new cases and augment the rehabilitation rate.",
            "Optimizing Epidemic Prevention and Control Strategies and Medical Treatment Guidelines",
            "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no direct cure or treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early detection, quarantine and treatment remain the most effective method to contain the coronavirus. The National Health Commission (NHC) has classified COVID-19 as a Category B disease requiring Category A measures in accordance with Chinas Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. Supported by the government and in partnership with their international counterparts, Chinese medical institutions have taken relentless efforts to improve medical treatment of patients and made remarkable achievements. So far, the NHC has released Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Control and Guidelines for COVID-19 Treatment and is updating them according to latest developments. The Ministry of Science and Technology, NHC, and National Medical Products Administration are also supporting research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in their efforts to screen and evaluate the most efficient drugs from all available or under-development medicines. Moreover, the central leading group on COVID-19 prevention and control is organizing resources of all levels to minimize the epidemics impact on psychological well-being of eligible people.",
            "Adapting Prevention and Control Strategies to Latest Developments",
            "Based on existing knowledge of the novel coronavirus, the 4th edition of the Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Control emphasizes the importance of effective mobilization and timely coordination among all medical institutions and underscores the imperative of adherence to the principles of early detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early quarantine, and early treatment. Besides, it has updated the monitoring methods, epidemiological survey tactics, and restrictive measures regarding close contacts and asymptomatic infections. For example, it specifies how to detect asymptomatic infections and outlines the requirements that have to be met before those asymptomatic patients can be discharged from medical observation; meanwhile, concentrated quarantine is requested for close contacts in regions with adequate resources.",
            "Enhancing Capacity of Pathogen Detection and Clinical Diagnosis , Choosing Treatment Sites According to PatientsConditions",
            "Effective quarantine is most important for epidemic containment; and the improvement of detection diagnosis rates is key to patient identification. 2019-nCoV cases are mainly confirmed through nucleic acid tests. At the early stage of the epidemic, large numbers of infections were left unconfirmed and unreported due to deficiencies in testing methods, equipment, and techniques. As Wang Chen, a pulmonologist at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said on February 4, the two crucial issues in the current fight against the virus are improving the detection and diagnosis rates by increasing the amount of nucleic acid testing; and gathering all confirmed cases with mild symptoms for quarantine to prevent wider spread. At present, 40 testing institutions in Wuhan have been authorized to conduct testing of up to 10,000 persons per day. As our understanding of and clinical experience in treating the disease grow, the NHC has released the fifth edition of Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus Diagnosis and Treatment in which the category of clinical diagnosis is added to give confirmed cases the earliest possible standard treatment and improve the cure rates.",

            "In Relentless Search of Effective Medicines and Treatment Options",
            "Medical research institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world have been engaged in the endeavor to find the most effective treatment and drugs. As of February 6, there had been 36 clinical trials related to the novel coronavirus registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, covering a wide range of research domains, including Western medicine clinical research, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment, traditional Chinese-Western hybrid treatment, psychotherapy, and postrecovery rehabilitation. Approved by the National Medical Products Administration, a medical task force led by Wang Chen and Cao Bin of China-Japan Friendship Hospital launched Phase III of Remdesivir Clinical Trial on February 5. At the same time, Chinese experts have identified a number of Western and Chinese-patent drugs as potentially effective in containing the virus, such as Chloroquine, Arbidol, Darunavir, and Favipiravir; related animal tests and clinical trials are being conducted.",

            "Exploring TCMs Unique Advantages",
            "Apart from Western medicine and medical treatment, medical institutions in China are also exploring what role TCM can play in the fight against the virus. Eight patients, including six severe cases, were cured and discharged from Jin Yin Tan Hospital in Wuhan on February 3 after receiving TCM and traditional Chinese-Western hybrid treatment by experts from Guanganmen Hospital and Xiyuan Hospital, two preeminent hospitals affiliated to the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. As Dr, Li Guangxi, dean of the Department for Respiratory Diseases at Guanganmen Hospital, put it, traditional Chinese medicine has accumulated many best practices in fighting off infectious diseases and is now demonstrating its unique advantages in combat with the novel coronavirus. Thus, the 5th edition of Chinas Guidelines for COVID-19 Treatment advises medical institutions to give full play to TCM treatment, enhance traditionalChinese-Western hybrid approaches, and set up joint traditional Chinese-Western diagnosis and treatment mechanisms......to find out the treatment scheme most suitable to the actual conditions of patients and local weather conditions.",

To this end, two documents, Guiding Principles for Emergent COVID-19-Caused Psychological Crisis Intervention and Guidelines for Psychological Aid Hotline during COVID-19 Outbreak, have been released. Various free hotlines have been set up to provide a wide range of services (such as counselling, psychotherapy, and crisis intervention) to comfort and help those in distress or mental disorder caused by COVID-19.",
            "Full Governmental and Social Mobilization in China",
            "A Race with Time",
            "Time holds the key in the current war against COVID-19 epidemic; and victory depends on how much faster nationwide mobilization for assistance to Wuhan and Hubei comes before the spread of the deadly virus. Among the 9 million residents in locked-down Wuhan are those already under medical treatment and infected people who carry the virus in latency. Whether these asymptomatic carriers can be put under proper treatment in the fastest possible way is another key factor, as long delay may lead to family and community transmission on a much larger scale. Therefore, the central government is mobilizing and coordinating steady supplies of medical equipment and materials for Wuhan and Hubei, the front-line areas where tailored and targeted measures have already been adopted to build up local capacity in patient admission and treatment.",
            "First, a precisely tailored system has been established to leave no patient unattended or under-attended. Severe patients are treated in designated hospitals, while patients with mild symptoms are sent to other specified institutions. Suspected cases with fever will remain in fever clinics under medical observation. Patients with CT-confirmed lung inflammatory signs are gathered in institutions isolated from suspected cases to prevent cross infection. Close contacts with confirmed cases are monitored in either collective or at-home quarantine.",
            "",
            "Second, a three-level quarantine model has been put in place to improve medical resource allocation. The two new hospitals, Leishenshan and Huoshenshan, and other remodeled institutions have added 8,000 beds for severe patients in Wuhan and more than 10,000 beds are expected to be ready for use as more institutions are modified to admit patients. Three makeshift hospitals known as square cabin hospitals have been erected in Wuhan to provide 4,400 beds for patients with mild symptoms; and altogether more than 10 such hospitals will be ready for use soon. Hotels near hospitals have be temporarily turned into places for quarantine for potential virus carriers. So far, Wuhan has had 132 such facilities with 12,571 beds. This three-tiered quarantine model allowspatients in different conditions to receive the most appropriate treatment, which helps optimize the allocation of medical resources.",
            "",
            "Third, the central government is mobilizing more resources from all over China to reinforce Wuhan in the war against COVID-19 epidemic. To leave no patient unattended or under-attended requires a continuous inflow of medical workers and materials. Thus, the central government has made it clear that steady supply of materials for epidemic control in Hubei province, especially in Wuhan, is the top priority for the nation. The central government is in charge of coordinating provision of materials in short supply. Hubei must do its best in material management and allocation; and that more medical experts specializing in respiratory diseases, intensive care, and nursing will be sent to assist Hubei. As of February 5, 107 medical teams of 10,596 professionals had been sent to Hubei, most of them working in Wuhan. Moreover, 19 provinces and municipalities have been assigned to each help treat severely ill patients in a specified area in Hubei.",
            "Top Priority of the Nation",
            "At present, local governments around China are shifting their focus from curbing Wuhan-exported cases to cutting off sources of potential family and community transmission. More vigorous measures are taken and best practices widely shared. For example, successful models of social governance in some cities are being replicated nationwide, such as setting up quarantine sites, building square cabin hospitals, canceling social gatherings, and shutting down venues for public events. Population mobility is restricted to the minimum level and local residents are advised to stay at home.",
            "",
            "At the same time, public awareness of health and personal hygiene has been raised considerably in health education campaigns nationwide. The public is eager to learnanything about epidemic prevention and has begun to improve their diets and living habits. Health tips about respiratory diseases are perhaps the most popularized knowledge right now: for example, respiratory diseases are spread through contact, droplets and air; main symptoms include fever, cough, and diarrhoea; and wearing masks, washing hands often, using disinfectant, and sufficient ventilation can help protect against the diseases. As people come to realize that wild animals are the most likely hosts of coronavirus, many are calling for the government to totally ban the consumption and trade of wild animals.",
            "To guarantee timely and effective measures in the war against COVID-19 epidemic, local authorities are clarifying the respective powers, rights and obligations of the government, enterprises, and individuals by emergency legislation. For example, the standing committee of the Shanghai Peoples Congress has passed legislation authorizing the Shanghai municipal government to blacklist those who attempt to conceal their health conditions in the social credit system.",

Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, ZTE, iFLYTEK, and JD.com are all actively employing such technologies as big data, artificial intelligence, as well as 5G in long-distance diagnosis, screening, and medical services. Long-distance diagnosis services are used to reduce the likelihood of infection during hospital visits. Up to now, ZTE has launched a 5G long-distance diagnosis platform linking West China Hospital and the Chengdu Public Health Clinic Center; Tecent, Alibaba Health, and Ping An Health Cloud Company have also begun to offer online medical consultation services to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and prevent cross infection.",

A whole-genome testing and analyzing platform -- jointly developed by the Zhejiang Provincial CDC, Alibaba DAMO Academy, and MATRIDX -- has considerably improved the speed and accuracy of confirmation of suspected cases.",
            "In addition, AI technology has been widely applied to ensure medical supplies. For example, iFLYTEK has opened up its AI+Office platform to offer high-quality telecommuting services for enterprises and individuals. Zuoyebang.com provides longdistance education services. CloudMinds offers a number of multi-purpose robots to deliver goods and services in quarantine areas and to disinfect and clean wards.",
            "Lessons Learned",
            "Although the COVID-19 epidemic continues, China is well-positioned to win the ultimate victory against it. This monumental event offers China and the world a number of important lessons regarding international cooperation on global public health emergencies.",
            "First, a globalized world featuring more densely-populated metropolitan areas with higher population mobility poses unique challenges for epidemic prevention and control. Although mega-cities have generally established full-fledged public health emergency response mechanisms, yet economic, political, social, and security concerns all magnify decision-makers and the publics sensitivity to the outbreak of infectious diseases. Therefore, emergency response mechanisms, social mobilization systems, andreserve systems for strategic assets must be institutionalized in mega-cities. Besides, the competence of community-level officials and individuals public health awareness need to be improved through more training courses and mass education programs.",
            "",
            "Second, Chinas cross-region medical supply systems and coordinating networks for medical experts are playing a decisive role in the current war against COVID-19 epidemic. Rallying more than 10,000 medical professionals and coordinating huge amounts of medical materials to reinforce Wuhans public health systems at short notice is not only a result of the full functioning of the central and local governments, but also thanks to efficient logistics and professional/resource allocation. For sure, China can share its challenges and good practices with the international community.",
            "",
            "Last but not least, international cooperation proves increasingly important in the war against COVID-19 epidemic. In partnership with China, the WHO has been closely monitoring the epidemic and coordinating a concerted international response. National governments across the world have also extended a helping hand. As of February 7, more than 30 countries, including developing countries with medical supply shortages like Pakistan and Myanmar, have donated medical materials to China. Such acts of international humanitarianism indicate that in times of global emergency, international solidarity and coordination, rather than extreme rhetoric and excessive reaction, is what is needed for the well-being of the international community. For, as the Chinese saying goes, Saving him to whom youre tied from the river is saving yourself.",

Huang and his team have recently published a paper in the Lancet, the world's leading general medical journal, about some early findings on the clinical data of the first 41 novel coronavirus cases.",

            "Trevor Bedford, a researcher with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle, categorically denied the persistent stories that the epidemic was started by a genetically engineered virus, the Financial Times reported recently.",
            "Theres no evidence whatsoever of genetic engineering that we can find, Bedford told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle. The evidence we have is that the mutations (in the virus) are completely consistent with natural evolution.",

            "According to Bedford, the research was wrong on many levels. The genes it (the novel coronavirus) shares with HIV are extremely short sequences naturally shared by other organisms, he explained.",
            "In addition to medical experts, media outlets have also disseminated knowledge about the virus to the public using simpler terms. On The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Chinese Malaysian comedian and actor Ronny Chieng criticized the misinformation and racism surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.",
            "He told the audience that it is wrong to claim that drinking bleach, eating garlic, and rinsing your nose with saline solution help prevent the virus, and asked people to stop thinking of the virus as an Asian virus and stereotyping Asian people. The show has been watched by 960,000 viewers and liked by 23,000 viewers as of press time.",
            "In the face of unknown viruses, people often feel anxious and helpless, and the demand for information rises sharply. This has created a market for various rumors and conspiracy theories, according to Dr. Cheng Huang, an associate professor in the Department of Global Health at George Washington University.",
            "Bostons Chinatown has been severely affected by the rumors, seeing a significant decline in business. To combat the rumors, Boston has launched a social media campaign that encourages residents and tourists to patronize small businesses in Chinatown, and posts photos on the Internet under the tag \"Love Boston Chinatown.\" To show their support, several city councilors have also patronized Chinatown shops.",
            "Currently, false information about the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic is spreading, which is not helping the world make an effective response, Professor and Director of Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security Rebecca Katz told Peoples Daily, adding that the world needs to fight the spread of misinformation, and authoritative public health officials should provide reliable information on a daily basis.",
            "The rumors and conspiracy theories have diverted the public's focus from epidemic prevention, and established an imaginary enemy for the people, making them forget that the virus we are fighting against is the enemy of all mankind, Huang said."

She received a WeChat message from her younger brother, saying all the family members she had contact with were quarantined and the community she lived in was sealed off.",

The Black Death that erupted in 1347 swept across Europe, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 25-30 million people. Before it was eradicated, smallpox plagued humanity for at least 3,000 years. In the 18th century, the number of Europeans who died of smallpox was estimated at over 150 million. And in the 20th century alone, smallpox took the lives of more than 300 million people.",
            "The death toll of the 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have reached 50 million, while World War I resulted in the deaths of about 40 million. The outbreak of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 in Mexico and the US in March 2009 lasted for more than a year, affecting 214 countries and regions and resulting in approximately 284,500 deaths. In 2014, the Ebola virus disease spread to multiple countries in just a few months, killing more than 7,000 people in West Africa. Infectious diseases have killed more people than wars and natural disasters.",
            "To combat infectious diseases, humanity has continued to improve medical technology and public sanitation, which has ensured health security and promoted scientific and technological progress. In this sense, fighting diseases, especially infectious diseases, is one of the driving forces in the development of human civilization. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century.",
            "At the end of the 18th century, British doctor Edward Jenner created and promoted the smallpox vaccine, which greatly curbed the possible outbreak of the variola virus and reduced the death rate. In 1928, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a powerful antibacterial drug, ending the era when infectious diseases were incurable. In 1972, Chinese scientist Tu Youyou successfully extracted artemisinin for the treatment of malaria, which has saved millions of lives worldwide, especially in developing countries. Tu was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2015.",
            "Since the 18th century, some European countries have taken the lead in the construction of urban sanitation facilities, improving water and sewage systems as well as centralizing waste treatment and disinfection. All these measures have effectively prevented infectious diseases such as the plague. In modern times, the concerted efforts of the international community have eradicated some once rampant infectious diseases. For example, the World Health Organization announced in December 1979 that the world was free of variola virus.",
            "The ongoing epidemic of the novel coronavirus-related peneumonia is another example of infectious diseases that has alarmed humanity. Faced with this major public health emergency, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has been leading the Chinese people in the war to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic. The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core attaches great importance to the prevention and control of the epidemic, and to the interests of the people. It has set up a leading group responding to the pneumonia outbreak, and established an all-around and multi-level epidemic prevention and control system. All relevant measures are being carried out in an orderly and effective manner.",
            "A level I emergency response that includes swift measures has been activated in 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. Each authority has spared no effort to allocate medical resources in line with the policy of \"collecting patients, assembling experts, centralizing resources and focusing on treatment.\" The country has dispatched working groups to guide local authorities in terms of improving diagnosis, treatment, emergency monitoring, epidemiologic investigation and sampling and testing.",
            "Thousands of medical staff have been storming into Wuhan to help. Factory employees have worked around the clock to produce medical supplies such as masks and protective outfits. The authoritative information on epidemic prevention and control has been released in a timely manner, and the interpretation of relevant policies and measures have been strengthened.",

            "China is also raising the public's awareness of the disease and people's ability to protect themselves from being infected. Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital were built within days. Green channels have been opened by customs across China to ensure the speedy entry of materials for epidemic prevention and control. Civilian charter flights have brought stranded overseas Chinese citizens home. The Chinese government has promised to cover the medical expenses of patients infected by the virus. Chinese people from all walks of life are donating money and materials to fight the epidemic.",
            "When the outbreak was first discovered, China did its utmost to implement epidemic prevention, control and rescue measures, maximizing the protection of people's lives and health. China also notified the WHO and relevant countries in a timely manner, proactively promoted international cooperation, and adopted measures to reduce the spread of the epidemic beyond its border. The country treated foreigners in China with kindness, demonstrating its responsibility.",
            "China's determination, measures and effectiveness have been a proactive response to the epidemic, and have been universally respected by the international community. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on January 30 praised the Chinese government for the extraordinary measures it has taken to curb the spread of the coronavirus, saying that \"China deserves our gratitude and respect.\" He said, \"We would have seen many more cases outside China by now - and probably deaths - if it were not for the government's efforts and the progress they have made to protect their own people and the people of the world.\"",
            "The WHO has confidence in China's ability to control the outbreak, and has not recommended any travel or trade restriction in response to the epidemic. Many countries, such as Germany, France, the UK, Russia, Thailand, Nepal, Tunisia, Cambodia, North Korea, and Cuba, and international organizations, including the European Union, the World Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have shown their appreciation and support of China's efforts in preventing and controlling the novel coronavirus.",
            "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday praised China's moves to fight the virus, saying, \"The Chinese authorities are taking decisive and vigorous measures in order to stop the epidemic.\" Jiji Press, a news agency in Japan, said that combating the virus is not a matter only for China. Silk Road Today, a media outlet in Kazakhstan, said that China's measures implemented to fight the virus are protecting not only China, but also the rest of world.",
            "However, there are still a few countries taking unfriendly measures toward China. A foreign media outlet even insulted the Chinese national flag on the pretext of the pneumonia. Overreaction toward Chinese citizens has also been witnessed abroad. Anyone in any country may be the victim of the epidemic, regardless of race or nationality. Anyone holding a rational, objective and fair stance will fully approve and respect the unremitting efforts made by the Chinese government and people to combat the epidemic, and will be deeply sympathetic to and firmly support the Chinese people.",
            "In the face of the severe situation, the Chinese government has always prioritized its people's safety and health. China understands some countries' concerns about the virus, but the international community should fully trust the Chinese government's ability to deal with emergencies. China's efforts in preventing and controlling the coronavirus have produced effective results. With the continuous enrichment of local healthcare resources and optimization of medical plans, the number of newly cured patients being discharged from hospitals has been rising every day. Chinese people are united in this fight to end the epidemic, and are sparing no effort to save lives. China will eventually win the battle against the disease, just as it defeated SARS 17 years ago.",

            "The U.S. political scientist Walter Russell Mead recently wrote an article infamously titled \"China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia\" related to China's role in the ongoing novel coronavirus. It is ridiculous to have this kind of thought in the 21st century, let alone by a well-known political scientist of the world's most powerful nation.",
            "Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out on March 23, 2013, in a speech in Moscow State Institute of International Relations that the West needs to keep pace with the times that the tide of history is unstoppable. \"We cannot have ourselves physically living in the 21st century, but with a mindset belonging to the past, stalled in the old days of colonialism, and constrained by zero-sum Cold War mentality.\"",
            "\"Sick Man of East Asia\" originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when imperialist China implemented a closed-door policy that led to years of isolation and internal turmoil, and the foreign powers took the advantage to force China to signing many unequal treaties.",
            "Today, China has implemented reforms and opening-up policies for more than four decades. With strong and effective leadership, not just the economy is growing rapidly, the Chinese people are also living more confidently than ever before. To label China as \"the Sick Man of Asia\" again in the 21st century is just outdated.",
            "Speaking of the coronavirus epidemic that broke out in Wuhan, many criticize Chinese authorities' response for being too slow. Because it is a new type of coronavirus that no one has met before, time was needed to understand and discover the origin of the virus, so that then physicians could make medication to cure it. Besides, the spread of the virus coincided with the travel season of the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays in which many people return to their loved ones in planes or high-speed trains, so the authorities also needed time to roll out policies to temporally stop all public transport in order to quarantine as many as possible.",
            "It wouldn't be easy for any country with a large population of 1.4 billion people, but when the policies rolled out, literally all people from metropolitan areas to city dwellers, from townsmen to the villagers started staying at home and wearing masks.",
            "To blame one country for lagging when it comes to dealing with the epidemic is irresponsible not only for the well-being of the Chinese people but also for other countries' citizens as well.",
            "In a blog post \"Bugs don't recognize nationality,\" two famous American public health advocates Chelsea Clinton and Devi Sridhar said in 2017, \"regardless of individual or even national views on the larger debate of insularity or openness, consensus exists  or at least could emerge  that cooperation is necessary for global health.\"",
            "From the beginning of the outbreak, the Chinese government has been very cooperative with experts around the world. With data from China, the World Health Organization set up a free online course for the public to get to know the epidemic better and to set up preventing precautions for themselves only in a week. Chinese pharmaceutical researchers also cooperated with world counterparts, including many from America.",
            "Moreover, many Chinese people overseas voluntarily purchased a large number of masks and other medical equipment from the countries where they live now and sent them to the land where their ancestors once lived to help their brothers and sisters out of this epidemic as soon as possible. To sit there do nothing and just blaming China over and over again cannot cure the patients, only by cooperation and looking for solutions together can we solve the problem.",
            "The logic is similar when speaking about China's economy. In a world that is so interdependent and in a year beginning with the uncertainty of the Brexit, no one wants to see the outlook of China's economy dampened by the ongoing coronavirus situation. Only by world cooperation may the pulse of China's economy beat stronger than ever and the world economy would benefit as a whole. By signing the first phase of the trade deal between China and the U.S., President Donald Trump showed a good example of how two powerful countries can and should give the world hope by doing good things together in a faltering time.",
            "Walter Russell Mead once said in his masterpiece that America's foreign policy has four schoolmasters, including Hamilton, Wilson, Jackson, and Jefferson. If that theory were not outdated, then the Hamiltonians would advocate cooperation with China, the largest trader with the U.S. now; the Wilsonians would consider American saving the world by saving America first, and with the world so interdependent in the 21st century, they definitely would cooperate with the Chinese to achieve that goal; the Jacksonians would defend U.S. interest in China, so they would also consider working with China to make that happen; only the Jeffersonians would be skeptical about intercourse with China, just as what Mr. Mead depicted in this \"Sick Man of Asia\" article.",
            "China is not the \"Sick Man of Asia\" and it will not be. But something in Mr. Mead's mind must be cured. He is famous for studying the history of America's foreign policy, but he needs to study more about the history of China and the determination of the Chinese people to fight against the novel coronavirus."

They believe that the focus of the short-term research should be developing easier means of diagnosis, providing the best treatment plans for patients, and the study on epidemiology.

            "Each medical worker infected with COVID-19 would receive a subsidy of 100,000 yuan (14,400 U.S. dollars), while the family of a deceased medical worker infected with virus would get 1 million yuan. The medical staff themselves, their relatives or colleagues can apply for the funds online.",

            "\"Actually, this is my first time to be a 'fraudster.' I could only send her the links to the CRCF official website, media reports and previous public information about the fund to identify myself as a volunteer,\" said the man, who found it both funny and annoying.",

            "The police never contacted him again. Instead, the nurse he had called before got in touch with him and admitted that it was her who had phoned the police.",
            "Still, Wu helped the nurse, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Jan. 25, submit the application materials. Later, both she and some of her colleagues received the funding.",

            "To help more medical workers trust him and get the aid they needed, Wu tried his best to show them more evidence of the fund's authenticity on WeChat. He also had more chances to interact with medics due to the volunteer work and found them both lovely and respectful.",

            "WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve is under pressure to lower interest rates in the next few months as the COVID-19 outbreak roiled global markets and posed downside risk to the U.S. economy, analysts said.",
            "\"COVID-19 poses downside risk to the U.S. economy, and though there are limits to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve may need eventually to step in,\" Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody's Analytics, wrote Thursday in a report.",
            "\"An emergency rate cut is unlikely, as these are rare. The most likely outcome is that the Fed continues to wait and see how financial market conditions fare and whether the coronavirus is having significant direct or indirect impacts on the U.S. economy,\" he said.",
            "Tim Duy, professor of the University of Oregon and a long-time Fed watcher, noted that virus-related concerns continued rocking financial markets and the market response is not unreasonable.",
            "\"The magnitude, both in terms of human and economic costs, of an outbreak in the U.S. remains very uncertain. It is not a surprise that market participants should fall into the 'sell first, ask questions later' mode,\" Duy wrote Friday in a blog post.",
            "All three major U.S. stock indexes tumbled into correction territory this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dived for the fifth day in a row Friday, falling more than 800 points, or more than 3 percent, shortly after the opening bell.",
            "Duy believed that the Fed \"has a clear role to play\" in the current situation and the central bank can't \"let runaway selling on Wall Street like we have seen this week continue and shake confidence on Main Street\".",
            "\"This is not just about a supply-side shock. This is now about preventing the soft-patch on the demand-side of the economy from becoming a recession,\" he said.",
            "While Fed officials don't have to cut rates now, they need to \"make clear they are prepared to cut rates much as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell did last June with his 'act as appropriate to sustain the expansion' comments,\" according to Duy.",
            "\"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,\" Powell said Friday afternoon in a brief statement before the financial markets closed for the weekend.",
            "\"The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy,\" he said, signaling the central bank is prepared to cut rates if necessary to support the economic expansion.",
            "\"Powell's comments on evolving risks and reassurance that the Fed would ease in response to COVID19-related weakness is no silver bullet but much welcomed signal of support for what has now become more of a panicked sell-off,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, a major accounting firm.",
            "The Fed lowered interest rates in July, September and October last year in an effort to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade tensions. After wrapping up its first monetary policy meeting of 2020 in late January, the Fed left interest rates unchanged and maintained a wait-and-see stance.",
            "James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, believed that these insurance cuts in 2019 have put the Fed in a good position to \"monitor the evolving coronavirus impact on the global economy\".",
            "\"Further policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time,\" Bullard said Friday at an event in Arkansas.",
            "The current federal funds rate target range stands at 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. The futures market currently assigned a probability of roughly 90 percent for a 50-basis-point rate cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
            "The odds of a Fed rate cut will increase if financial market conditions continue to tighten, according to Sweet.",
            "\"The Fed has shown that it will respond more quickly to an inversion in the yield curve, and a rate cut could help bolster investor sentiment,\" he said.",
            "John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, warned that Fed's rate cuts may fall short of stabilizing markets.",
            "\"What the Fed can do is help to facilitate access to financial capital for those households, businesses and local governments that incur cash flow problems owing to the virus,\" Lonski said, noting Fed's rate cuts by themselves will not remedy the COVID-19 virus.",
            "The virus is expected to trim U.S. economic growth by two-tenths of a percentage point to 1.7 percent in 2020, according to Moody's Analytics."

Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China, always being committed to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, has shared information with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the international society, actively responded to the concerns of each party and enhanced international cooperation in an open, transparent and responsible manner to prevent the global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The WHO believes that strategy can be done, she added.",

In the yellow fever outbreak, rumors had it that people vaccinated could not drink beer for a week, which directly led to the drop of vaccination rate; while in the Ebola outbreak, there was the rumor that the Ebola disease did not exist, which hampered treatment for some patients.",

The following is the text of the article.",
            "Q1: What is a coronavirus?",
            "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses found in both animals and humans. Some infected people are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).",
            "Q2: What is a \"novel\" coronavirus?",
            "A novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. The \"novel\" coronavirus, now called 2019-nCoV, has not previously detected before the outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China in December.",
            "Q3: How dangerous is the novel coronavirus?",
            "Infection with 2019-nCoV can cause mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. It can be more severe for some persons and lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties.",
            "More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.",
            "Q4: Can 2019-nCoV be transmitted from person to person?",
            "Yes, it can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient.",
            "Q5: What can I do to protect myself?",
            "Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub.",
            "Maintain social distancing -- maintain at least 1 meter distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.",
            "Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.",
            "If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early.",
            "Q6: Should I wear a mask?",
            "Wearing a medical mask can help limit the spread of some respiratory disease. However, it should be combined with other prevention measures including hand and respiratory hygiene and avoiding close contact.",
            "Q7: Is it safe to receive a package from China or any other place where the virus has been identified?",
            "Yes. From experience with other coronaviruses, we know that these types of viruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.",
            "Q8: Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV?",
            "To date, no. Some specific treatments are under investigation and being tested through clinical trials.",
            "The following measures are not specifically recommended as 2019-nCoV remedies as they are not effective and can be even harmful: taking vitamin C, smoking, drinking tradition herbal teas, wearing multiple masks, taking self-medication such as antibiotics which do not work against viruses."

Community workers and volunteers are also running between residential complexes in the cities to contribute their power. These scenes, emotional and shocking, will be remembered by history. Such powerful spirit released amid the epidemic is encouraging both the nation and the world.",

Their lofty aspiration for the country exactly carries the connotation of the shared destiny.",
            "Chinese people have made arduous efforts, and the nation has always stayed optimistic and resilient, and carried a conviction that it will achieve the final victory over the epidemic.",
            "At the Fang Cang makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, patients and medical staff encouraged each other, and the latter even danced with the discharged patients. No one knows how many sweats and tears were behind such optimism, but it is these tough people who are never defeated by hardships that make China stand sturdily in the world.",

The heroes going in harms way, the volunteers serving the people, the police officers at every checkpoint, the overseas Chinese donating supplies through chartered flights, and the Chinese medical experts flying to other affected countries to offer assistance, millions of Chinese are glowing in this war without gunfire, forming a united and indestructible power to get through the difficult time.",

            "Addressing the 146th session of the WHO Executive Board meeting that kicked off here on Monday, Tedros called on all countries to implement evidence-based measures to tackle the virus, reaffirming that the WHO stands ready to provide advice to countries on how to manage the outbreak.",
            "Last week, Tedros declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).",
            "Outside China, there are 151 confirmed cases in 23 countries, and one death, which was reported from the Philippines on Sunday, Tedros said.",
            "\"If it weren't for China's efforts, the number of cases outside China would have been very much higher,\" he reiterated.",
            "\"The decision to declare a PHEIC was taken primarily because of the signs of human-to-human transmission outside China, and our concern of what might happen if the virus were to spread in a country with a weaker health system,\" he added.",
            "Tedros spoke highly again of the Chinese leadership's commitment in fighting the epidemic.",
            "The WHO chief further explained that the current effort should remain focused on fighting the virus at the epicenter and the source, which could slow down and minimize the spread of the virus to other countries.",
            "While showing confidence in keeping the outbreak under control, Tedros also warned, \"don't make a mistake, it can get even worse. But if we give it our best, the outcome could be even better.\""

            "A paper published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the electron micrographs of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).",
            "The virus particles were generally spherical, with some pleomorphism. Their diameters varied from about 60 to 140 nanometers. They had quite distinctive spikes, about 9 to 12 nanometers, which gave them the appearance of a solar corona, according to the paper.",

            "Over 60 percent of these patients had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, which is considered the source of the coronavirus outbreak.",
            "The paper indicated some similar symptoms between the novel coronavirus cases and SARS. The common symptoms at onset of illness included fever, cough and fatigue. About 55 percent of the patients developed dyspnoea. Less common symptoms were sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea.",
            "\"Although some symptoms are similar to those of SARS, such as fever, dry cough and dyspnea, there are still important differences. Novel coronavirus patients have no upper respiratory tract symptoms, such a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat,\" said Professor Cao Bin, correspondence author of the paper from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Beijing-based Capital Medical University.",

            "The HKSAR government will set up a 10-billion-Hong Kong-dollar fund to support the community in preventing and controlling the outbreak. It will also review the four rounds of economic relief measures it announced last year and may extend their validity or intensify them if necessary, he said.",

            "As the COVID-19 epidemic control situation in the US deteriorates, inconsistent statements from its government regarding the virus have thrown the public into confusion, displaying its lack of ability and readiness to tackle the threat.",
            "In a public statement made during his visit to India on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said that the coronavirus is very much under control in the US, and its a problem thats going to go away. On the same day, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow also noted that the US has already contained the virus.",
            "Trump once again downplayed the risk at a press briefing Wednesday, saying, Whatever happens, were totally prepared.",
            "",
            "However, other government officials took a different view, slamming such comments as simplification and misleading. Alex Azar, the administrations secretary of Health and Human Services, struck a more serious tone, telling Congress, We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus, and we need to be realistic about that.",
            "The divergence of views between government officials regarding COVID-19 control reached boiling point on Tuesday, when Senator John Kennedy criticized acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf for his ignorance of the virus during a tense grilling on the US response to the outbreak.",
            "Wolf failed to answer virtually all of Kennedys questions, including how many people he believed would become infected, how many respirators and masks are available and how many would be needed for a wider outbreak. To make things worse, Wolf told the senator that a vaccine could be only a matter of months away, contradicting testimony from an earlier congressional briefing that it would take 12 to 18 months.",
            "The US failure in taking sufficient measures to contain the H1N1 outbreak in 2009-2010 and its slow response to natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina have cast doubt on the abilities of the US government emergency response system.",
            "I cannot believe that our top national security leader could be so ignorant about the coronavirus. As an ordinary citizen, I dont even know who I should believe. The US barely satisfactory performance in the battle against 2009 swine flu seems to have made little progress a decade later, commented a netizen named Thomas Hudson.",
            "Similar farcical episodes have been taking place in US politics since the coronavirus outbreak began, displaying the US governments ignorance and inability to tackle the crisis. Instead of coming up with a solid and detailed plan, US politicians have spent their time pointing fingers at China, smearing the Communist Party of China and Chinese political system, which have mobilized the entire nation in the fight against the novel coronavirus.",
            "Ironically, one month after some US government officials and several media outlets slammed China for locking down the city of Wuhan, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued the first US federal quarantine order since the smallpox outbreak in the 1960s. Almost 1,000 Americans have now faced or are currently facing mandatory 14-day quarantines.",
            "The coronavirus epidemic control situation in the US is far less promising than is being portrayed by President Trump. Secretary Azar noted that the country has a stockpile of 30 million N95 surgical masks, but that 300 million would be needed to protect health workers in an outbreak. Even worse, the CDC warned that a larger spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus across the US could overwhelm emergency rooms and cause shortages of crucial medical supplies, especially when the seasonal flu, with more than 26 million cases and many hospitals stretched thin, is at its peak in the country.",
            "\"It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but more really a question of when it will happen  and how many people in this country will have severe illness,\" warned Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the CDC."

            "Peter Beilenson, Sacramento County's top health official, was quoted Friday by the Sacramento Bee newspaper as saying that he expected that a few of employees from UC Davis Medical Center, where a woman infected by the virus was treated, to test positive.",
            "The patient, who lives in a 100,000-population community named Vacaville located between the cities of San Francisco and Sacramento, had not been exposed to the virus through travel or through any contact with any infected individual, according to the authorities.",
            "The woman was admitted to the NorthBay VacaValley Hospital, a small hospital near the Vacaville in Solano County, on Feb. 15 with cold or flu symptoms. She was transferred to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento on Feb. 19 due to the seriousness of her condition. Tests taken on Feb. 23 showed that she was suffering from the novel coronavirus.",
            "In total, more than 100 employees of three hospitals are believed to have been exposed. In addition to those at the Vacaville hospital and UC Davis Medical Center, another three employees recently were sent home from Kaiser Permanente South medical center in Sacramento.",
            "\"I expect there will be a few positives, probably asymptomatic,\" Beilenson said, adding that he based the prediction on early data indicating 80 percent of people infected by the new virus have mild symptoms or none at all.",
            "Meanwhile, Solano County Health Officer Bela Matyas also expected more cases to emerge.",
            "\"The best guess is that there are people who are not showing symptoms, but, are, nevertheless, infected. That's a very normal way for diseases to spread,\" Matyas said.",
            "At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Matyas noted local authorities changed their approach to the virus from containment to control, saying that \"we recognize that if we do have community spread, that it becomes necessary to consider more aggressive protection of our critical resources.\"",
            "That not only means testing and screening, but also being more rigorous at the hospital level, as Matyas said, to \"universally assume the possibility\" that a patient seeking care and has flu- or cold-like symptoms may carry the virus."

            "The first of the 10 measures is to clean hands regularly with an alcohol-based hand rub, or wash them with soap and water. Touching the face after touching contaminated surfaces or sick people is one of the ways the virus can be transmitted. By cleaning the hands, one can reduce the risk.",
            "Second, clean surfaces regularly with disinfectant, for example kitchen benches and work desks.",
            "Third, educate oneself about COVID-19, but make sure the information comes from reliable sources such as local or national public health agencies, the WHO website, or local health professionals. The symptoms, for most people, start with a fever and a dry cough instead of a runny nose. Most people will have mild disease and get better without needing any special care.",

Take extra precautions to avoid crowded areas or places where interaction with people who are sick is possible.",
            "Seventh, everyone who feels unwell should stay at home and call doctors or local health professionals who will ask about the symptoms, where one has been and who one has had contact with. This will help to make sure that one gets the right advice, is directed to the right health facility, and will prevent from infecting others.",

So is China's commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva on Jan. 30.",

            "Obviously, to respect the authoritative suggestions from the WHO and take measures recommended by the organization to avoid the impacts on regular international exchanges of personnel and practical cooperation in each field is what countries should do in the face of the current epidemic.",
            "Whether countries can evaluate the severity of the epidemic in a just and rational manner, and inform the public about the low mortality rate and the fact that the cured cases have outnumbered the deaths to avoid secondary crisis has become a standard that measures wisdom, rationality and humanity. Its foreseeable that it will be much easier for the world to get through the current difficulty as long as this standard is met by all countries.",
            "However, some countries ignored the WHO recommendation that there was no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. Their overreaction and measures have caused trouble for normal international travel. Such exaggerated measures have triggered panic and are indulging the emergence of hostility, vicious remarks and evildoings. This has no doubt signaled an alarm.",

However, some western media, with ulterior motives, called the virus a yellow peril made in China, publicly labeling the Chinese and even Asians. As a result, some people in western countries even committed violent crimes targeting Asians. Such ridiculous remarks and practices will do nothing to help the world combat the coronavirus, but only instigate racism and create panic.",
            "Without doubt, the mainstream public opinion in the international society still stands with justice and righteousness. Any prejudice or discriminatory action against China is now condemned by the power of justice, as the practices and achievements made by the Chinese people to race against time and combat the epidemic are touching the world. Many foreigners have denounced the discriminatory remarks, saying such remarks are stupid and intolerable. With ImNotVirus hashtags, they posted messages on social media saying that the epidemic is not an excuse for exclusiveness and the crisis shall not overwhelm humanity.",

He stressed that the situation is a public health emergency and not an issue of race or nationality, and is a problem that all countries must work together to solve.",
            "Leaders from Germany, Canada and the Philippines also made voices to stop discrimination. Michael Levitt, winner of Nobel prize in Chemistry and a scholar of virus research pointed out that western media broadcast what is happening in China from a selfishly focused perspective: how to limit the outbreak of illness outside the countrys borders. How narrow and sad that they never give China a voice or send words of encouragement and solidarity, he said.",
            "Panic shall never worse the epidemic, and solidarity to protect lives shall never be obstructed. It tells from the human history of battles against viruses, especially todays world where globalization is developing in a profound manner that the experiences in and lessons learned from the epidemics of influenza A/H1N1, MERS, Ebola and Zika all proved that the impacts of public health issues are beyond borders. We are all in this together, and we can only stop it together, said Tedros in a statement.",

These forceful measures are hailed as a good example for epidemic response.",

I think China has done a good job with their quarantine operations,\" Kennedy said.",

Few people realized a looming epidemic caused by a new, highly contagious and lethal coronavirus would soon cause severe scarcity of personal protective items ranging from masks to disinfectant.",

            "She voiced hope that the disease would be able to be contained quickly.",

            "Jay Rayner, a journalist, writer and restaurant critic, visited Chinese restaurant Four Seasons located in London's Chinatown and published a review in The Observer newspaper.",
            "\"This is a review with a simple message: go and support your local Chinese restaurant. Go show them that ethnicity is not a marker for disease,\" he said, adding that it was also \"an act of solidarity with Britain's Chinese community which has suffered via misplaced racist fear over coronavirus.\"",
            "The 53-year old writer noticed that Gerrard Street in Chinatown was \"sparsely populated\" and chairs and tables in the restaurants \"sit forlorn and empty,\" as the fear over COVID-19 has impacted badly the business of the Chinese restaurants, although the \"nasty virus has broken out in a city 5,500 miles (about 8,851 km) away from London.\"",
            "\"I've never seen it like this before,\" he wrote. \"There are reports of abuse on the streets, of Asians being shunned on public transport. Across the Chinese restaurant sector, business is down. The mother of one Anglo-Chinese friend calls it 'health-linked racial discrimination.' It doesn't matter what excuse you choose for your racism. It's still racism.\"",
            "As a regular customer, Rayner said he did not need to visit Four Seasons to write about it.",
            "\"But this is an act of solidarity that also gets me roast duck,\" he said.",
            "\"The opening up of China has brought us the country's thrilling variety from Sichuan to Shanghai, from Hunan to Xinjiang and back again,\" Rayner said at the end of his review, adding that he was staggered to see that the once mainly Cantonese Chinatown has grown from \"a tiny cluster to a vast district apparently representing all the provinces.\"",
            "\"Britain's Chinese restaurant offering is more diverse and exciting than it's ever been. Please go and eat in one. Now,\" he concluded.",

            "The unhealthy attitude of certain Americans amid the public health emergency of the novel coronavirus pneumonia is becoming more and more annoying for the international society.",
            "A recent message posted on social media by Ho Ching, wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, drew wide public attention. Forwarding a report by U.S. media that made irresponsible remarks on Chinas political system, Ho questioned that And what about the influenza B deaths in the USA?",
            "To contain the spread of the novel coronavirus as soon as possible, China has launched a peoples war against the epidemic, adopting the strictest and most thorough measures. Foreign governments and people across the world are also joining Chinas efforts to combat the epidemic in different ways. The World Health Organization (WHO) and global public health experts contributed constructive suggestions.",
            "However, some U.S. politicians and media outlets have been making tart and even vicious remarks on Chinas efforts to contain the epidemic. Their irresponsible attitude presented a sharp contrast with the global efforts to support China.",
            "They acted as on-lookers who gloated over Chinas misfortune. Some even took the opportunity to seek political gains, smelling blood in the epidemic regardless of their loss of morality.",
            "The arrogance of these Americans is ridiculous, as if they had forgotten how their own country was coping with public health emergencies.",
            "When the Zika virus spread over the American continent in 2016, the U.S. was one of the major afflicted areas. The White House requested the Congress to allocate $1.9 billion in February, but encountered a party conflict which was quite American Style. Because of the dispute over legislation strategies, the allocation was postponed by 7 months, and only $1.1 billion was available, even though the Democrats and Republicans both understood the importance of the matter.",
            "At that time, there were over 23,000 infections in the U.S. and its Commonwealth Puerto Rico, including 2,000 women in pregnancy, the most vulnerable group to the virus. Besides, over 20 infants were found to have congenital defects because of the Zika virus.",
            "The actions taken at the critical moment in the battle against epidemics are a mirror that reflects countries governance capability. National governance shall take peoples needs as a priority, and the government must spare no effort to meet peoples expectations. The delayed response of the U.S. in the epidemic control caused by party conflict is by no means reasonable.",
            "In 2009, when facing the influenza A (H1N1) virus, the U.S. government first said there was no need for alarm, then suddenly declared it a national emergency, which many experts believed to be a misguidance for the world. As a result, the flu ended up spreading to 214 countries and regions.",
            "Whats more, the U.S. government also paid lip service in its promise to offer vaccines for the public. It promised to have 160 million doses of injectable vaccine on hand by October that year, but only less than 30 million doses had been prepared. According to a report issued later, the downsizing and expenditure cut of public health departments weakened the countrys prevention and control work of the flu.",
            "Some people in the U.S. can always wax lyrical when they point fingers at other countries, but turn their backs on the vulnerability of their own countrys system in coping with epidemics.",
            "America is not a perfect country, just as many American public health experts stressed that the country is not ready for the challenges posed by major infectious diseases. Director of Harvard Global Health Institute Ashish Jha warned that epidemic is the most possible cause that can rapidly and accidentally kill millions of Americans, but also one that sees the least preparation.",
            "Countries across the world should help each other and rely on complementary advantages in public health emergencies. The successful practices of a country may serve as a reference for others. American author Mario Cavolo recently published an article that compares the 2009 H1N1 virus in the U.S. and the 2019 novel coronavirus in China on social media LinkedIn. He pointed out that it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency in 2009, and the death toll was vastly underestimated and updated not until three years later.",
            "In the article, Cavolo said the forces attacking Chinas efforts are bizarrely negative, and the world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad and aggressive response.",
            "When these Americans are trying to blame Chinas endeavor in an arrogant and indifferent manner, what they really care about is not how to contain the epidemic in an early date or the lives of the people across the world. Whats in the mind of these on-lookers is indeed unpresentable calculations.",
            "However, those who lost their sense of humanity can never prevail. To politicalize the epidemic and launch inhumane attacks will only destroy their own image.",

            "It was not until Feb. 6 that he was urged by his family to go to the hospital as his fever never improved. When he climbed the stairs at the hospital that day, his chest was so tight that he had to take off his mask to catch his breath.",
            "\"At that moment, I was so scared,\" he said.",

            "Now, Kang enjoys his life at the hotel. Apart from doing aerobics and viewing short videos on Douyin, he talks more with his family on the phone or China's social media platform WeChat.",
            "He even set up a WeChat group for his unit to invite the patients discharged from the hospital to share their latest situation and cheer each other on.",
