The second issue was in 2007 of 1.55 trillion yuan for establishing the State-owned foreign exchange investment company.",

Analysts expect the final costs to be higher, due to larger subsidies for small-and medium-sized companies and stronger spending on medical supplies.",

            "Q: How long will the lockdown in Wuhan last?",
            "A: When the number of new cases greatly decreases, or even no more new cases are reported, we can surely remove the restrictions. After all, most people in Wuhan, a city with a population of more than 10 million, are not infected. It's crucial to curb the infection source, cut the transmission route and protect vulnerable groups.",
            "Q: Why was Wuhan put on lockdown?",
            "A: The status of the epidemic is so urgent that it brooks no delay. Only by strictly controlling the infection source can we stop the pandemic from spreading in a wider range.",
            "According to the current situation, people exiting Wuhan resulted in infections in other provinces, and second generation transmission has appeared in some provinces, which is really dangerous. If the infection develops over a larger range and the epidemic in other provinces spreads in a way like Wuhan, the nation's economy will suffer severe losses.",
            "Q: Does the novel coronavirus only transmit through the respiratory tract?",
            "A: The transmission through the respiratory tract is definite. Meanwhile, transmissions via blood, excrement and contaminated objects need to be verified.",
            "Q: Do people get infected during the incubation period of novel coronavirus?",
            "A: I've been doing research on this and so far I have found that the virus is able to transmit during the incubation period. That's why we put those having contact with infections within 14 days under medical observation and quarantine.",
            "Q: How do we distinguish between the common cold and novel coronavirus pneumonia?",
            "A: The early symptoms of the two are similar, including fever, dry cough, respiratory symptoms, and fatigue after fever. Some even showed up in the digestive tract.",
            "The most important way to distinguish it is by taking samples from throat swabs to test for the virus. The report clearly tells whether the tester is infected with H1N1, type B influenza or novel coronavirus. The reagent test kits are supposed to be accessible in designated hospitals.",
            "Q: Can patients with milder symptoms stay at home for quarantine?",
            "A: Recently a doctor reported he was cured by taking therapies at home on his own, which I think may work for him. As a doctor he knew medical knowledge and his own condition, so he didn't fear the virus and had a good rest.",
            "But it's safer to go to hospital if you are lacking medical equipment, as a regular chest CT is needed to check if the infection is getting worse. If you are not medical personnel with a clear awareness of your physical condition and the inflammation develops quickly, you should go to a hospital for treatment.",
            "The epidemiologist Li Lanjuan also suggested in the interview that people should avoid large gatherings, frequently wash their hands, wear masks and make sure their indoor air is circulating during Spring Festival."

            "A group of scientists from Imperial College London has reportedly become the first team outside China to begin animal testing on a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.",
            "The virus, which causes new coronavirus-infected pneumonia, which the World Health Organization named this week as COVID-19, has killed hundreds and sickened thousands, mainly in the Chinese mainland after making the leap from infecting animals to infecting humans. The newness of the virus in humans means there are currently no vaccines, and no proven therapeutics.",
            "Researcher Paul McKay told the French news agency Agence France-Presse that the team hopes to have an effective vaccine ready for mass production by the end of the year.",
            "\"At the moment, we have just put the vaccine that we've generated into mice,\" he said. \"We're hoping that, over the next few weeks, we'll be able to determine the response that we can see in those mice, in their blood, their antibody response to the coronavirus.\"",
            "Scientists in China are also understood to be at a similar stage in the drive to develop a vaccine.",
            "Such research is usually is a long, drawn-out process that involves animal testing, human trials, and meticulous checks, but the World Health Organization is understood to be seeking safe and effective ways to speed up the process.",
            "The new virus is a strain of a well-known virus that has been effectively controlled by vaccines in the past.",
            "The researchers at Imperial College London hope research and testing carried out almost two decades ago into the SARS coronavirus will speed up the current process.",
            "\"We're hoping to be the first to get this particular vaccine into human clinical trials, and that perhaps is our personal goal,\" McKay said. \"Once the phase one trial is complete, which can take a few months  it can be immediately started into an efficacy trial in people, which will also take a few months to complete.\"",
            "The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which was established during the 2017 World Economic Forum in Davos to foster cooperation between universities and pharmaceutical companies, is funding much of the world's research into a vaccine. However, AFP reports that the Imperial College London team is self-funding.",

            "Imperial College London is playing a significant role in the battle against the virus.",
            "Researchers led by Imperial's Professor Neil Ferguson became the first in the UK to accurately estimate the size of the outbreak. And that 1 percent of people with the disease will die from their infection.",
            "Ferguson told the BBC he believes the number of new cases will continue to rise.",

            "John Oxford, an emeritus professor of virology at Queen Mary University London, said on Radio 4's Today program on Wednesday that the virus does have a weakness, and everyone can play their part in defeating it, regardless of the development of a vaccine.",

            "Why has the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus increased dramatically?",
            "The sharp increase of confirmed cases has a lot to do with the ability of the coronavirus to spread. Currently it seems that human-to-human transmission is getting stronger.",
            "Another factor contributing to the rocketing number of infections lies in the timing of the epidemic outbreak, which happened in early December. As the Spring Festival travel rush kicked off less than a month later, people in areas with severe infections traveled nationwide, which accelerated the spread of the disease.",
            "Wuhan, Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak and with a backlog of suspected cases, has seen especially rapid growth of confirmed cases due to the recent centralization of diagnosis.",
            "Why did the number of confirmed cases surpass that of severe acute respiratory syndrome in a shorter time?",
            "The research shows that human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus is similar to SARS, which means that a patient can infect two to three people on average.",
            "However, the doubling time of the novel coronavirus is shorter than that of SARS. Compared with nine days to double the number of infected cases in terms of SARS, it only takes about six or seven days for the novel coronavirus.",
            "Are the changes in the novel coronavirus the reason for the increase in infected children?",
            "The increase in child cases might be related to the various chances of human exposure. People at different ages are all susceptible to the new respiratory pathogen. But the chance of exposure may vary due to different ages, and so does the incidence.",
            "It's observed that the symptoms of the pneumonia disease seem to be less severe in a child than an adult. No critical conditions have been reported in child cases.",
            "Will there be another outbreak period of the novel coronavirus in the future? When can the epidemic be basically controlled?",
            "It is very difficult indeed to predict the epidemic trend at present. With multiple measures having been taken, we will effectively control the spread of the coronavirus. But we can't have high hopes it will be done in a week.",
            "We must continue to strengthen prevention and control measures and step up diagnosis and treatment efforts in areas of severe infections, as well as enhance the detection of infected cases in other places. We will also trace people with close contact with patients and put them in medical observation. The epidemic will be brought under control as long as all the measures can be put in place.",
            "What's the point of extending the Spring Festival holiday? Is there a need to further extend it?",
            "It's a very important strategy to control the spread of respiratory infectious disease through human-to-human transmission by reducing the flow of people and personal contact, as well as increasing interpersonal distance. Chinese authorities extended the Lunar New Year holiday as a key measure to control the spread of the novel coronavirus.",
            "The longer the holidays are, the better control of the epidemic will be. But we also have to balance things because people still have to live and work, and emergency materials have to be produced and transported.",

            "Over the weekend, the number of COVID-19 cases passed the 100,000 mark in 100 countries.",
            "The organization's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference on Monday that the speed and width of the spread is certainly a matter of concern.",
            "\"Now that the coronavirus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,\" he said. \"But it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled.\"",
            "Tedros emphasized that the great advantage in this scenario is that the decisions made by governments, businesses, communities, families and individuals can influence the trajectory of the epidemic. As evidence, he cited the fact that of the 80,000 cases reported in China, more than 70 percent have recovered and since been discharged.",
            "So far, 93 percent of all cases reported globally are concentrated in four countries; China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. \"It's never too late to turn back the tide,\" said Tedros.",
            "\"The facts that China and Singapore are turning the corner give me a lot of hope,\" added Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program.",
            "Maria Van Kerkhove, the program's technical lead, recently returned from a two-week trip to China. \"We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, absolutely,\" she said. \"But how quickly we get there will depend on what countries do.\"",
            "Tedros said that countries that continue to find and test COVID-19 cases and trace their contacts are not only protecting their own people, but can also affect what happens in other countries and globally.",
            "\"The rule of the game is: Never give up,\" he said, adding that success can only be achieved with aggressive action as early as possible. \"Half-hearted measures will leave the door ajar for the coronavirus.\"",
            "The WHO chief said he was encouraged to see Italy taking aggressive measures to contain the epidemic. \"We hope that those measures prove effective in the coming days,\" he said.",
            "Italy is the nation hardest hit by COVID-19 in the European Union. At the weekend, the Italian government announced a lockdown across much of the north of the country, which has been most affected by the virus, in an attempt to contain its spread.",
            "The 27-member EU is struggling to deal with the challenge, given the open borders between many nations. On Monday the European Council announced several new preventive measures, including reducing the number of meetings and size of delegations at meetings, as well as suspending all visitor groups and non-essential training.",
            "Council President Charles Michel tweeted on Monday that he will hold a conference call with members to coordinate EU efforts on COVID-19.",
            "The French government has already agreed to ban public events with 1,000 people or more as part of its efforts to halt the spread of the virus.",
            "Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn also called for events with more than 1,000 attendees to be banned, but the power to implement such restrictions lies with local authorities."

            "China is sparing no effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, a challenge to both China and the international community, by adhering to openness and transparency, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai said.",
            "\"So we always have, as one of our basic principles, openness and transparency,\" Cui said in an interview with National Public Radio on Thursday. \"We believe openness and transparency will give people more confidence, will give them more awareness about the virus, what the real risks are and how to prevent them.\"",
            "\"We are providing, you see all the figures, the numbers on a daily basis, just to make people reassured that we're doing our most to confront it,\" Cui said. \"This will certainly help us to dispel any fake news, rumors or what people call pseudoscience.\"",
            "Noting the novel coronavirus outbreak was \"a very big challenge to the entire international community,\" the ambassador said that China has taken an unprecedented response to curb the spread of the virus for people's well-being as well as the interests of the entire world.",
            "\"So we are shutting down some of the cities, especially Wuhan, to stop the transmission of the virus, to protect more people,\" Cui said.",
            "Despite the \"high cost\" of the current efforts, Cui said that \"we are doing this in the larger interests of the entire world. If we fail to stop the virus, it could spread to other countries. Then this would cause an international crisis.\"",
            "The ambassador said China is making utmost efforts to contain the virus by providing people with treatment and reducing its impact on economic and social activities.",
            "\"So this is, I believe, a real example of a one-for-all, all-for-one situation,\" Cui said. \"We are doing this for the world. And we appreciate that the world is helping us.\"",
            "On the so-called \"decoupling\" between China and the United States, which some U.S. experts suggested the current outbreak would promote, Cui said that \"decoupling\" should not happen, nor can it happen.",
            "\"Because we are the two largest economies in the world. We are so interconnected, so interdependent. This interdependence has worked in the interests of both countries,\" said Cui. \"Both economies, both peoples have benefited a great deal from such growing economic ties. Why should anybody try to cut it off, to have this so-called 'decoupling'?\"",
            "Cui cited the phase-one economic and trade agreement between China and the United States as evidence to dismiss the \"decoupling\" theory, and expressed hope that the deal will be \"implemented effectively,\" which he said is \"a big plus\" for overall China-U.S. relations.",
            "\"The good news is that we have concluded the phase-one trade agreement. This is evidence that there's intention on both sides to solve our economic problem and maintain and develop our economic relations,\" Cui added.",
            "The China-U.S. phase-one economic and trade agreement takes effect on Friday. As part of the agreement, the U.S. government agreed to cut additional tariffs on roughly 120 billion U.S. dollars' worth of Chinese products from 15 percent to 7.5 percent, while China would also halve rates of additional tariffs on 75 billion dollars' worth of U.S. products."

            "The former refers to cases in which the virus spreads from one human to another, who is not able to further infect other humans. The latter refers to cases in which the virus can spread across generations, posing much greater threat to us. No cases of the latter scenario have been detected.",

            "Wearing face masks tightly is also important. If mist appears on your glasses, it means you are not wearing it tightly.",

            "Why have many medical workers, with all the protective gear they wear, been infected by the virus while few family members of patients contracted the disease?",
            "It is because the aerosol produced in the process of intubation of pneumonia patients is highly contagious. It heightens the risk of medical workers contracting the virus.",

            "A: The novel coronavirus is likely to spread by fecal-oral transmission. The issue should be taken very seriously, because the virus has been found in fecal samples of infected patients. We should be highly alert about the fact the virus can spread through fecal matter. In some places of Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, people have a habit of using chamber pots as toilets and washing them in fish ponds, which indeed needs attention.",
            "Further research and surveying should be done to see how many patients have feces with the virus. Based on preliminary understanding, the virus hasn't been detected in patients' urine.",
            "Q: How does the development of the epidemic go so far?",
            "A: So far, the confirmed cases are mainly from Wuhan. I haven't looked at the data this morning. The data yesterday showed Wuhan was still the major place of the outbreak. As a result, I think the central government's decision of putting Wuhan into lockdown is right. It seems there is no obvious outbreak in places other than Wuhan.",
            "Q: What do you think of the surge in the number of confirmed cases?",
            "A: The number is rising now and the rising trend will continue for some time, but I'm sure it won't be long.",
            "Q: The peak of people's return trips is coming soon. Anything people should pay special attention to?",
            "A: I have said before people who will return to Wuhan will not be a problem, because they haven't been infected before. More than 10 days have passed, so the incubation stage of potential patients is almost over. People who are infectious have already been in treatment in local hospitals, and the others who are OK now will stay fine. However, those who leave Wuhan for other places should be closely watched.",
            "Q: What should we pay attention to in the prevention and control of the disease in communities?",
            "A: The prevention and control work in communities is very important. People living in a community can keep an eye on each other on many issues, including wearing masks, which to some extent plays a decisive role in prevention and control of the virus."

            "Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health used the cryogenic electron microscopy to map the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19.",

            "The study found the 2019 novel coronavirus shared the same functional host-cell receptor called ACE2 with SARS virus, but ACE2 binds to the novel coronavirus with affinity about 10 or 20-fold higher than its binding to SARS virus.",
            "The findings may provide a potential explanation for the apparent easy human-to-human transmission demonstrated by the novel coronavirus, but Jason McLellan, associate professor at UT Austin who led the study, told Xinhua that it's still unclear whether this higher affinity binding has any impact on the transmissibility of the virus.",
            "McLellan also said they still don't know why the novel coronavirus binds tighter at a molecular level.",
            "He has sent the atomic coordinates of the spike protein to many laboratories, with the majority based in China. \"About 25 labs from China have asked for them so far,\" he said.",
            "Researchers can use the coordinates to begin virtual drug screening to identify small molecules that may bind to the spike and disrupt its function, or to design novel protein molecules or antibodies that bind to the spike and inhibit its function, as well as to perform protein engineering to try and make variants of the spike with improved properties, such as higher expression levels or thermal stability, which can be advantageous for vaccine development, McLellan said.",

            "Q3: How dangerous is the novel coronavirus?",
            "Infection with 2019-nCoV can cause mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. It can be more severe for some persons and lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties.",
            "More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.",
            "Q4: Can 2019-nCoV be transmitted from person to person?",
            "Yes, it can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient.",
            "Q5: What can I do to protect myself?",
            "Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub.",
            "Maintain social distancing -- maintain at least 1 meter distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.",
            "Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.",
            "If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early.",
            "Q6: Should I wear a mask?",
            "Wearing a medical mask can help limit the spread of some respiratory disease. However, it should be combined with other prevention measures including hand and respiratory hygiene and avoiding close contact.",
