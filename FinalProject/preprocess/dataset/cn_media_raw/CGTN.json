            "South Korea has raised its alert level for the COVID-19 by one notch to the \"highest\", President Moon Jae-in said Sunday, due to a sudden spike in the number of infections.",
            "\"The COVID-19 incident faces a grave turning point. The next few days will be crucial,\" Moon said following a government meeting on the virus. \"The government will raise the alert level to the highest level according to experts' recommendations,\" he added.",
            "South Korea on Sunday reported 123 more confirmed cases of the COVID-19 and a fifth death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea (KCDC). The national toll of 602 infected cases is now the highest outside China, besides from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak on the Japanese coastline.",
            "According to KCDC, 63 have been linked to the outbreak at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the country's fourth-largest city Daegu, after a 61-year-old woman known as \"Patient 31\" who attended services at the church tested positive for the virus last week.",
            "More than 1,000 people who attended the church have reported flu-like symptoms so far.",
            "Officials are also investigating a possible link between churchgoers and the spike in infections at Cheongdo hospital, where more than 110 people have been infected so far, mostly patients at a mental illness ward.",
            "\"The government will sternly deal with acts that interfere with quarantine efforts, illegal hoarding of hygiene goods and acts that spark uneasiness through massive rallies,\" South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun warned in a nationally televised address.",
            "South Korea's earlier cases were linked to China but the new infections center on Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million, and a hospital in Cheongdo, a county with about 43,000 people.",
            "In response to the recent sharp rise in cases, the KCDC designated both the city of Daegu and Cheongdo county as \"special care zones\" on Friday.",
            "Since the first outbreak on January 20, four have died from the virus in South Korea. The fourth patient who died on Sunday was a 57-year-old man who was at the Cheongdo hospital, according to the KCDC.",
            "A day earlier, nine of the 39 South Korean Catholics who had gone on a pilgrimage to Israel earlier this month were confirmed to have been infected with the virus.",
            "Catholic churches in the cities of Daegu and Gwangju and elsewhere have suspended mass and other gatherings.",
            "By Saturday, the virus had been identified in two more countries, Lebanon and Israel, bringing the spread to 28 countries. The death toll in Iran rose to six, accounts for the highest in any country outside China, and the number of confirmed cases there reached 28.",
            "Ali Aghazadeh, governor of Markazi Province, said late on Saturday that tests of a patient who recently died in the central city of Arak were positive for the virus. The person was also suffering from a heart problem, he told the official IRNA news agency.",
            "The infection first surfaced in Iran on Wednesday, when authorities said it claimed the lives of two elderly people in Qom, a Shia holy city south of the capital.",
            "The Ministry of Health said most of the confirmed cases are either \"Qom residents or have a history of coming and going from Qom to other cities.\"",
            "As a \"preventive measure\", authorities ordered the closure of schools, universities and other educational centers in 14 provinces across the country from Sunday, according to state television.",
            "In Tehran, meanwhile, all bistros and water fountains in the subway stations are closed downuntil further notice.",
            "\"We are on the front lines, we need help,\" head of Qom's medical sciences university said on state TV.",
            "Iran has yet to confirm the origin of the outbreak, but one official in the health ministry, Minoo Mohraz, quoted by the IRNA saying that, \"Since those infected in Qom had no contact with the Chinese [...] the source is probably Chinese workers who work in Qom and have traveled to China,\" she added, without providing any supporting evidence.",
            "World Health OrganizationDirector-GeneralDr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press briefing that \"window is narrowing\" to prevent a COVID-19 pandemic, but there are still hopes."

            "If you want to see the worst-case scenario for the spread of any virus, you need look no further than a cruise ship. The cruise companies know it.",
            "At the best of times, cruise liners take plenty of precautions to prevent outbreaks of anything from the common cold to norovirus. They're hygiene-conscious, disinfecting on a regular basis and expecting passengers to take precautions too.",
            "The problem is that a ship is such an enclosed space. Hundreds or even thousands of people might be sharing buffets, or swimming pools, or toilets. Even under quarantined conditions, air is still circulated through ventilation systems. The \"population density\" on a cruise ship is far higher than any city.",
            "Crew accommodation is even more cramped, and work must still be done to serve food to passengers  hopefully without contamination. However sympathetic I might be to passengers on the Diamond Princess, my heart goes out even more so to the crew.",
            "However hygiene conscious you might be, the challenges of keeping a virus under control are substantially more difficult at sea than on land. When cruise ships are described as \"floating Petri dishes,\" it's not a bad analogy. Australia's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy said, \"Cruise ships are well known as a place where communicable diseases can be rapidly transmitted.\"",
            "I can't blame cruise companies for being cautious. When an 83-year-old American MS Westerdam passenger tested positive for COVID-19, quarantine measures were put in place. Nobody else was infected, which at first seems like a massive disease control success story. It's no longer certain, though, whether she ever had COVID-19 at all.",
            "The American Center for Disease Control first issued a statement saying that she did not, then retracted the statement. Cambodia has also questioned the initial positive test result, whereas Malaysia defends it. Caution is certainly a good thing, but the confusion surrounding this case makes it difficult to know what  if anything  we can realistically learn from the MS Westerdam.",
            "The precautionary principle is important, although it leads to temporary disruption whenever there is a potential case: the Costa Smerelda was held in lockdown, only for it to later transpire that the passenger concerned simply had a case of the flu.",
            "The Diamond Princess is the only cruise liner on which there is a clear, known outbreak. It's tempting to be highly critical of the quarantine efforts on board, but for a ship with 1,100 crew and around 2,600 passengers  few with any medical training  the size of the task facing them was huge.",
            "There are 695 known cases of those who were on board the Diamond Princess, a total of almost 20 percent of those on board. While the quarantine clearly failed, crew members continued to work under difficult conditions and effectively risked their lives to ensure that they were still able to provide food to the passengers.",
            "Crew members share toilets, eat communally in a mess hall, and share sleeping arrangements. Maintaining an effective quarantine would have been difficult no matter how efficient the systems.",
            "According to Kentara Iwato of Kobe University, \"the cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control.\" When members of the crew became sick, there were no spare cabins; so they initially had to continue to share with healthy colleagues.",
            "With no separation between contaminated and non-contaminated areas of the ship, there was no chance of containing the virus. Calls to evacuate the ship went unheeded, with the number of cases increasing accordingly.",
            "Shigeru Omi, who was previously a regional director of the World Health Organization, pointed out that \"the ship was not designed to be a hospital. The ship was a ship.\"",
            "By failing to evacuate the ship in a timely manner, we should have learned something about the worst-case scenario for how the virus spreads. It should be possible to use the data to improve scientific models, which could then inform future disease control methods. Yet even that data has not been forthcoming. Academic research which could help us learn how to control the virus has been delayed by slow information-sharing.",
            "The situation on the MS Westerdam, where it is still not entirely clear whether or not a patient did have the COVID-19, highlights another inconvenient feature of the virus.",
            "The amount of the virus produced by the human body may vary from day to day, and symptoms are often uncorrelated with levels of the virus within the body. A single negative test for the COVID-19 does not completely rule out the possibility that a patient may have it.",
            "Both crew and passengers have been failed by a slow response from the international community regarding the Diamond Princess. The lack of research, and uncertainty over what actually happened on the MS Westerdam, has generated more questions than answers. That should not be the case.",

It was the second nationwide teleconference Xi attended after the outbreak.The meeting was aimed at analyzing the current situation, mobilizing the whole Party, nation and society to ensure reaching the poverty alleviation goal on time, and ensuring that the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be accomplished, Xi stressed.He urged Party committees and governments at all levels to overcome adverse impacts of the epidemic and secure a complete victory of the battle against poverty.",

Below are the answers from officials and experts at a Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council press conference on the progress of medical research against the virus on Saturday.",
            "Several drugs found effective in clinical trialsSeveral drugs, including rendesivir, chloroquine phosphate and fapilavir, have been screened and have shown good clinical efficacy in treating the novel coronavirus, according to Zhang Xinmin, director of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology.Rendesivir, a new antiviral drug by U.S. company Gilead that reportedly cured a patient in the U.S., has shown good inhibiting effects on the virus and quite a high level of safety in vitro experiments, Zhang said. The drug, originally aimed at infectious diseases like Ebola, has not hit the market yet because its clinical trials have not finished in the U.S.It is now undergoing clinical trials on patients in Wuhan for efficacy. \"We are looking forward to the final results,\" Zhang said. Chloroquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug that has been on the market for many years, and fapilavir, an overseas marketed drug for flu, have also been found effective in clinical trials. \"China has green-lighted all administrative passes to treat and cure the patients. But when it comes to science, the standard cannot be lowered, and the scientific procedures have to be followed to develop a new drug,\" said Zhou Qi, a professor at the Institute of Zoology of Chinese Academy of Sciences.",
            "No vaccine available worldwide yetNo vaccine for the novel coronavirus is on the market so far, said Yan Jinghua, researcher at the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). But the development of a vaccine has always been a main thrust, and multiple approaches have been used in it, said Zhang Xinmin, director of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). To speed up the research and development, \"a number of candidate vaccines are under development in parallel, including an inactivated vaccine, a mRNA vaccine, a recombinant protein vaccine, a virus vector vaccine and a DNA vaccine,\" said Zhang.Currently, some vaccine varieties have entered the stage of animal testing.Read more:",

            "Bats the most likely natural host for the coronavirusA study of the genome sequences of the coronavirus carried out by the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the CAS has found that bats are the most likely natural hosts, said Wu Yuanbin, director-general of the Department of Science and Technology for Social Development under MOST.The team at the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center tested over 4,800 samples of pigs, birds, dogs, cats and other animals collected in recent years, all of which showed negative results. It was initially ruled out that the novel coronavirus originated from poultry and livestock, Wu said.A total of 585 environmental and animal samples collected from the Huanan Seafood Market, where the virus is believed to originate from, and several other fresh food markets in Wuhan have been detected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the results suggest that the outbreak may be linked to the wildlife trade, according to Wu.Virus tracing is essential to revealing the origin and evolution of the virus, eliminating the source of the epidemic and preventing the spread of the epidemic, he said."

            "The novel coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has now spread to 12 countries, has much in common with seasonal flu. They are both viral infections, share similar symptoms and - crucially - can spread from human to human. In the midst of flu season in much of the northern hemisphere, telling the difference between the two will be vital in stopping its spread.",
            "Are the symptoms similar to that of the flu?",
            "Human coronaviruses, of which there are four, can cause respiratory infections similar to flu: while many symptoms are mild, both can lead to pneumonia and become lethal. However, the novel coronavirus is more serious than a \"typical influenza infection,\" says Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading. \"This virus appears to go further down into the lungs than would generally be the case, therefore giving you symptoms of pneumonia: the lungs becoming flooded, they don't function very well and the patient gets into breathing difficulty.\"",
            "How dangerous is the novel coronavirus compared to flu?",
            "Jones found it \"mildly alarming\" when deaths exceeded 100 on 28 January, although he noted that the mortality rate could still be low as it's unclear how many people are currently infected.",
            "\"If that 100 is out of 100,000 then the rate is actually very low - something like seasonal flu,\" says Jones. \"On the other hand, if the 100 are out of only the 4,000 confirmed (cases) the rate is a little bit high and it would seem to be quite dangerous.\"Although many cases are mild, annually the flu causes up to five million cases of severe illness worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that flu kills up to 650,000 people annually.",
            "Why is it more feared than the flu?",
            "While the mortality rates and symptoms of flu and novel coronavirus may end up being similar, humans' ability to fight off the viruses differ greatly. Humans have naturally built up antibodies to seasonal flu and scientists have developed annual vaccines to fight it. During a pandemic, which the new coronavirus has the potential to become, \"there is no immunity in the population so you have potential for a global spread,\" warns Jones. There is also a widespread familiarity with flu, which dampens concern. As with the Ebola epidemic and the Zika virus, both of which peaked in the middle of the last decade, fears around the new coronavirus are compounded due to a lack of knowledge over its nature.",
            "Is it as easy to catch as the flu?",
            "Flu can spread from person to person from up to six feet away, largely caused by liquid emitted when the inflicted cough or sneeze. Those infected are usually contagious for around three days following the beginning of their illness, although this time-frame could stretch to over a week. All this and more remains a mystery in regards to the new coronavirus. To understand the virility of the outbreak, Jones urges a focus on whether or not international cases lead to secondary infections. \"If they don't,\" he explains, \"it would suggest that the virus doesn't transmit quite so well: clearly all the people on the airplane (that traveled from an infected zone) didn't get it.\"",
            "What you should do if you think you have it?",
            "Medical advice is similar across those countries with confirmed cases of the infection. In France - where there have been three confirmed cases - authorities are asking those who think they are infected to call an ambulance rather than visiting a hospital, where they could potentially pass on the virus. Similar advice has been issued in China and Germany, which has today confirmed its first case, believed to be the first person-to-person transmission on European soil."

It is a popular year-round vacation destination that attracts many northern European visitors.The Italian doctor who tested positive for COVID-19 has been quarantined in a local clinic while samples are analyzed in a hospital near Madrid to confirm the initial diagnosis, announced ngel Vctor Torres, president of the Canary Islands, late on Monday in a series of tweets.Spanish private news agency Europa Press, citing the regional government's health department, said the doctor had arrived from one of the areas in northern Italy where COVID-19 has infected hundreds. The patient voluntarily went to a clinic in Tenerife on Monday when he began feeling unwell, Europa Press reported.It is Spain's third case of COVID-19 and the second in the islands. A German tourist was quarantined earlier this month on the island of La Gomera and a British citizen was isolated in the Mediterranean's Balearic Islands. Both were released after recovering and showing no further symptoms of the illness.The Spanish government has convened a special commission of various ministries and a separate meeting with health authorities of all the Spanish regions to assess preparations for a possible uptick in cases.In Italy, seven people have died, while a further 229 have tested positive for the virus. Police are manning checkpoints around 11 quarantined northern towns, in which an estimated 50,000 people live."

            "Scientists from Australia, France, the United States and China are using new technology in an ambitious, multi-million-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.",
            "Coming up with any vaccine typically takes years, and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals. But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases.",
            "\"It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,\" said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia's University of Queensland. But he added he took \"some solace\" knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission.",
            "\"The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,\" he said.",
            "Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.",
            "With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals.",
            "Attack the virusThe body's CEO, Richard Hatchett, said the aim was to start clinical testing in just 16 weeks.German biopharmaceutical company CureVac and U.S.-based Moderna Therapeutics are developing vaccines based on \"messenger RNA\"  instructions that tell the body to produce proteins  while Inovio, another American firm, is using DNA-based technology.DNA- and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body's cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases program at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.The immune system learns to recognize the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body.The Australian researchers are using \"molecular clamp\" technology invented by the university's scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence.French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months.Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also accelerated developing vaccines.",
            "Risks vs. benefits",
            "Health authorities weigh the risks and benefits in vaccine approvals and if there is a public health emergency, the process could be shortened, said Ooi of the Duke-NUS Medical School. But he added that \"paradoxically, if the situation improves, then actually the pathway for vaccines would be longer.\"",
            "\"If there's a lot of these new coronavirus cases around, then you accept some risk, because of the tremendous amount of benefit you can derive, whereas if there are not many cases, the tolerance for risk would be very low.\"",
            "While there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, some doctors are trying out a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs to treat those infected, but the science is inconclusive as to whether they are effective.",
            "Ultimately, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  it died out before a vaccine could be fully developed.",
            "A close cousin of the new coronavirus, SARS spread around the world and killed nearly 800.",
            "But Ong Siew Hwa, the director of Acumen Research Laboratories, a biotech company in Singapore, said efforts to develop a vaccine for the new virus should continue even if the outbreak ends.",

            "\"It was like a light switch was flipped,\" said Shiu, who had stocked up and had an ample supply of herbs on hand for his patients.",
            "Kamwo Meridian Herbs, a shop in the heart of New York's Chinatown and a longtime supplier to practitioners like Shiu, has experienced a similar jump in demand for traditional Chinese remedies for respiratory and other ailments.",
            "To counter the outbreak in China, which has reported nearly 81,000 cases, the government initiated a series of emergency research programs that include traditional Chinese medicines, which are widely used in the world's most populous nation.",
            "Last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally recognized traditional medical therapies such as acupuncture and herbal supplementation medicine, conferring more mainstream recognition of the practices, which date back more than 2,500 years.",

Against the backdrop of an imposing apothecary cabinet, workers loaded herbs onto old-fashioned weighing scales as customers placed orders for formulas that include honeysuckle, cinnamon twig, peony root and other substances.",
            "Since the outbreak began, members of the close-knit traditional Chinese medicine community have been sharing formulas for prevention and treatment, helping boost demand for certain ingredients and driving up prices, Shiu said.",
            "Patients infected by the coronavirus, which has already contributed to at least 22 deaths in the United States as of Monday and nearly 4,000 worldwide, often present symptoms such as fever and cough, similar to those found in influenza patients.",
            "To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19.",
            "Supply woes",
            "At Calihouse Nutrition, a tiny shop in the heart of New York's Chinatown, Patrick Siu was dealing with a steady stream of customers who were inspecting shelves and barrels filled with herbs and roots.",
            "A 40-pound supply of medicinal herbs that would normally last two to three weeks now sells out in just a few days, he said.",
            "Best-selling items such Japanese honeysuckle and the popular cold remedy Ban Lan Gen Chong Ji were already hard to find and prices were rising fast, according to Siu, 48, who emigrated to the United States from Hong Kong in the late 1980s.",
            "With demand so high, herb purveyors and practitioners have become concerned about a growing supply crunch for certain herbs that come almost exclusively from China.",
            "Mayway, a Chinese medicine business in San Francisco, said on its website that it had experienced an \"unusual increase in ordering quantities\" and asked its customers to limit their orders to what was needed. It said it anticipated supply delays \"due to the low volume of container ships currently leaving China,\" according to its website.",
            "\"Vendors have told us you can't order more than 50 percent of what you normally do, (you) have to ration for flu herbs,\" said Thomas Leung, chief executive of Kamwo. \"I'm not freaking out about it, but we are keeping an eye on it.\"",

Vice President Mike Pence was put in charge of the situation, despite his record as governor of Indiana, where he was broadly criticized for his handling of an outbreak of HIV.

            "The facts on the ground suggest otherwise. Similarly, the question of whether those without health insurance would be tested or have to pay hundreds of dollars has remained unanswered. Journalists tried to ask that at a press conference given by Pence, but he simply walked out.",
            "Thus far, the Trump administration's efforts have resulted in the suggestion of a payroll tax cut, possible subsidies for the most affected industries (airlines, cruise ships, and hotels), and screening of every person entering the U.S. from the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Italy  following initial claims he would close the border with Mexico, for reasons that remain unclear.",

The U.S. has one of the worst sick pay records in the developed world, particularly in the hospitality sector, precisely where the virus could be most easily transmitted.",
            "The ideological basis of Pence and Trump's approach has been \"We'll do it our way.\" No need to listen to experts, or to communicate calmly and rationally with the public. (Trump's \"Fake news!\" tweets have looked astonishingly ill-judged.) It has harked back to the laissez-faire economic policy of the nineteenth century, where government interference was unsought and unneeded.",

            "This has hardened into a libertarian orthodoxy, where freedom trumps every other concern. No-one should be able to force you to do anything. All action should be voluntary. So social programs  which as Winston Churchill once said bring \"the magic of averages to the rescue of millions\" - by taxing some to provide assistance to others are anathema to the libertarian mindset. Any welfare or social program does this, but it is in healthcare that the American way is most evident.",
            "Health insurance in the U.S. is very largely treated as a product: You get what you pay for. But it's really more of a public good. Markets operate when a buyer and seller can interact on equal terms and with full knowledge  that's why we have consumer protection societies and rules on packaging. There is no equality of terms when you are ill: You are in no place to haggle and cannot switch between suppliers if you dislike what is being offered.",
            "For decades, the U.S. has managed to cope without an activist federal government. But the cracks have become increasingly obvious. Infrastructure in the U.S. has decayed significantly: The American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated that the U.S. needs to spend some 4.5 trillion U.S. dollars by 2025 to improve the country's roads, bridges, dams, airports, and schools. Trump's own repeated pledges of \"Infrastructure Week\" have likewise turned out to be empty promises.",
            "Even when disasters did strike, they  and there's no way around this blunt fact  largely affected the poor and disenfranchised, and so could be forgotten about. The effect of the deadly storms of Hurricane Katrina on Louisiana and Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico ought to have seen huge rescue and reconstruction missions. Instead George W. Bush left the poor in New Orleans to fend for themselves and Trump tossed over some paper towels when in Puerto Rico.",
            "State governments have, noticeably, taken a far more activist approach. California and other states have promised free virus checks. Eight (New York, California, Washington, Florida, Oregon, Utah, Maryland, and Kentucky) have declared a state of emergency and promised free virus tests. They have a much more direct responsibility for the daily lives and concerns of their residents. Competence matters at the point of delivery, not ideology. Other institutions have taken the matter into their own hands: Universities such as New York University, Columbia and Stanford have opted to deliver classes online.",
            "These, though, are fragmented actions rather than evidence of a national plan. The presidency is the bully pulpit, the focal point for the U.S. A major part of the job is to communicate with people at times of anxiety. Trump however seems blinded by ideology, incapable of realizing that government is about the needs of its citizens. All that he is communicating is his indifference to his fellow Americans.",

The service, which was launched in January 2019, had to be suspended following the outbreak of COVID-19.

            "\"We anticipated the service would be suspended due to the Chinese New Year, that was a three-week break, but in view of the coronavirus and the closure of Wuhan terminal and in addition to that, the trucking restrictions in China and the factory closures, we delayed the service for a further three weeks,\" said Tony Cole, head of supply chain services at Davies Turner, who oversees the project for the 150-year-old firm.",

            "Xi stressed continuing to take epidemic prevention and control as a task of paramount importance.",
            "Speaking highly of the sacrifice of Wuhan people, Xi said with their concrete actions, Wuhan people have demonstrated the strength and spirit of China, as well as the Chinese people's love for family and the nation, which enables them to stick together through thick and thin.",
            "Xi hails medical workers as 'true heroes'",

The free movement of people, in its purest embodiment within the Schengen Area, covers countries both within and outside of the European Union. Only the Republic of Ireland, together with the United Kingdom, decided not to join  though neither shares a land border with mainland Europe. Given the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy, by far the largest so far within Europe, it's not surprising that questions have arisen about the potential for cross-border infection.",
            "Healthcare systems vary dramatically from country to country, even within Europe; the COVID-19 virus knows no such borders. Freedom of movement can, by law, be suspended temporarily \"in the event that a serious threat to public policy or internal security has been established.\" So far, Italy has steadfastly refused to suspend the provisions of the Schengen Agreement and reintroduce border controls along its Northern border.",
            "The decision has raised eyebrows; across the Atlantic, a New York Times headline screams \"Coronavirus nightmare could be the end for Europe's borderless dream.\" European federalists, for whom open borders are almost an article of faith, seek to stick to Schengen no matter what. Right-wing populists call for borders to be completely closed. It is entirely expected that both sides of this debate tend to approach this issue in the same way as they have approached Schengen generally: the system is a trade-off between convenience and control.",
            "In my view, in this particular situation there exists a halfway house between the two options: to treat a land border in the same way as an international flight from a country with a significant number of infections. Temperature screening might be an imperfect science, resulting in occasional false positives and false negatives, but such precautions are far better than doing nothing.",
            "Dr. Clare Wenham, of the London School of Economics Global Health Initiative, said \"travel restrictions don't work: people find another way around it. It might only slow the virus down.\" This is certainly true, though one of the key strategic objectives is precisely that: to slow it down, in the hope that more effective treatments might be found or a vaccine might be made available.",
            "Antiviral medications are in the testing phase to determine whether they improve the overall prognosis; a vaccine has potentially been found but cannot even be trialed until April. The use of border infrastructure to identify potential cases would, I believe, be a proportionate response.",
            "Outside Italy, the COVID-19 is broadly under control in Europe  for now. Most infections are traceable; the new cases in Denmark and the United Kingdom are directly linked to travelers returning from Italy and Tenerife. Germany, though, has sounded the alarm: they have partially been unable to trace the history of one sufferer. Lacking the so-called \"Patient Zero\", not knowing the source of a chain of infection, disease control becomes a far more challenging task.",
            "In the United Kingdom, following a meeting of the UK's high-level emergency COBRA committee, Health Secretary Matt Hancock updated Parliament by explaining the British four-step plan to \"contain, delay, research and mitigate\" the virus. Within the European Union, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides seeks EU co-ordination of national healthcare responses.",
            "This is an aspiration rather than policy: the European Union has no direct control over national healthcare systems. Even so, with some European nations having fewer than a million people, they will certainly look somewhere  whether it is to the larger powers or to the European Union  for guidance on how to respond.",
            "Yet whilst a virus knows no borders, neither does research. We live in a globally inter-connected age where the genetic code of a virus can be shared at the click of a button with scientists around the world. The best practice is shared between countries. The appropriate response to the COVID-19 is not a British response, or an Italian or European or Chinese response. It is a global response.",

            "Given this, perhaps one should not feel too discouraged about the newly released PMI data of February: the number has hit a historic low at 35.7, meaning the manufacturing activities contracted sharply last month. The contraction is mainly due to the aggressive control measures that the Chinese government taken, which resulted in a delayed resumption of factory work, and a sharp decline of demand.",

They didn't seem to care as I passed them wearing the mask: very few people across Munich are sporting any sort of facial protection, and on social media the overriding theme is simply to keep your hands washed. Even so, face masks are very limited throughout the city and hand sanitizer is only available through Amazon.",
            "Once home, I gathered my laptop and some papers and quarantined myself in our bedroom. My husband was relegated to the couch and as it had just been a week-long holiday in Bavaria, our son was with his grandparents.",
            "I watched movies, listened to music, slept, mindlessly scrolled through social media sites and read the news. My husband made me food and left it on a tray outside the bedroom door. I couldn't help but feel like I WAS infected, even though by now my initial symptoms had diminished: having caught up on a lot of sleep, I was feeling perfectly normal.",
            "On Sunday evening, the Bavarian health authority rang; they checked how I was feeling and asked me to repeat the entire story again of where I had been and why I did the test. Finally, they revealed that the coronavirus test was negative. I let out a big sigh of relief, only to have it punctured by a big \"but\"",
            "In splendid isolation",
            "Because there is so much still unknown about the virus and its transmission, they \"advised\" me to stay in home isolation for another week. That would take it to 14 days from when I initially came in contact with the infected person at that press conference in Milan, which now feels like months ago. My son, too, would have to stay another week with his grandparents. Lucky them.",
            "Since that call, I have been able to take off the mask and leave the bedroom, but my husband is still on the couch and has to do the food shopping. That being said, I've been able to catch up on some long-overdue tasks, all our clothing is ironed and the house has never looked so clean. I've even taught myself how to cook a few meals.",
            "The biggest difficulty is having to be away from my son. My husband has now gone to be with him and his parents, so I have the entire house to myself. Perhaps it's time for a bubble bath and that lovely Swiss chocolate I picked up on the way home. I think I'll be just fine getting through the final four days of home isolation...",

            "What's the worst that could happen?",
            "Health experts have said that a person is most at risk of catching the virus if they come into contact - within one meter - with someone who is infected.",
            "The World Health Organization says that on a plane, contact with an infected person is defined as being seated within two rows of them.",
            "So what is the risk of catching a virus on an airplane?",
            "A team of researchers carried out a study in 2018 to determine just that. Obviously this was a general look at a virus rather than the novel coronavirus, and they assumed there was one person on board with the virus: they did not go into the odds of whether or not there might be someone with the illness on the plane.",
            "Led by health experts from the U.S.'s Emory University and the FlyHealthy Research Team, the study observed the behaviors and movements of individuals on 10 single-aisle aircraft on transcontinental U.S. flights.",
            "Researchers looked at how people moved around the cabin, and the effect of this on how often and for how long they came into contact with others. They wanted to estimate how many close encounters might allow for transmission during transcontinental flights.",
            "\"Our results indicate there is low probability of direct transmission to passengers not seated in close proximity to an infectious passenger,\" the study found.",
            "How do you protect yourself and where should you sit on the plane?",
            "The researchers concluded that passengers in the window seats were the least likely to come into contact with the infected person.",
            "Passengers within one row of the infected person, in this case meaning the 11 nearest neighbors, have the highest probability of becoming infected.",
            "However, on planes people don't often stay seated for the entire duration of the flight. Passengers get up to go to the bathroom, grab something from the overhead compartments, or even just to stretch their legs.",
            "The study found that 38 percent of passengers left their seat once and 24 percent left more than once, while another 38 percent remained seated for the duration of the flight.",
            "Those least likely to leave their seats, and thus to have the least amount of contact with other passengers, were in the window seat. Their close encounters averaged at 12 contacts compared with 58 and 64 contacts for passengers in middle and aisle seats respectively.",
            "So the best bet to minimize any risks of infection would be to sit in a window seat - and to avoid moving around during the flight if you can.",
            "Health experts maintain that the best way to keep yourself and others from becoming infected is to maintain good hygiene. Sneezing or coughing into a tissue before throwing it away will keep the virus from transferring onto surfaces around you.",
            "Washing your hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds will go far in eradicating the possibility of catching the virus or passing it on to others. Hand sanitizer, or antibacterial hand gel with alcohol content over 60 percent, can also help clean your hands while you're on the go.",

            "Theory 3: Evidence washed away",
            "With the local government cleaning out the seafood market, chances of identifying the intermediary host of the outbreak are bleak.",

In return, when their work was done, they were considered a \"yellow peril\" As the New York Daily Tribune put it in 1854, Chinese were \"uncivilized, unclean, filthy beyond all conception, without any of the higher domestic or social relations.\" So for their reward, new Chinese were essentially barred from the country for 61 years from 1882 by the sole law in U.S. history to restrict entry to the U.S. explicitly on the basis of race, the Chinese Exclusion Act.",

            "There's no question that the virus is clearly affecting global supply chains and the economies impacted by them. It's important to look beyond the current crisis, however. In my opinion, one casualty of the virus is the unrealistic Trumpian view of countries going it alone. As this current experience demonstrates, we're all connected. This means that now, more than ever, that Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision of a community with a shared future has been validated and is the one the international community must follow for future personal and economic health and prosperity.",

The direct damage to the target organ and the resulting systemic inflammatory response from SARS-CoV-2 may be the main pathogenic mechanism after human infection, Liu said, adding that the work on cerebrospinal fluid as well as other related examinations should be improved.COVID-19 patients could also see complications related to severe respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, kidney injury and other organ damage.

            "Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) has already sent an advance team to China, the Chinese ambassador pointed out that China has to \"have some ordered manner to have experts from other countries,\" as the whole country is so preoccupied with combating the virus.",

            "On the so-called \"decoupling\" between China and the United States, which some U.S. experts suggest the current outbreak would promote, Cui said that \"decoupling\" should not happen, nor can it happen.\"Because we are the two largest economies in the world. We are so interconnected, so interdependent. This interdependence has worked in the interests of both countries,\" said Cui. \"Both economies, both peoples have benefited a great deal from such growing economic ties. Why should anybody try to cut it off, to have this 'decoupling'?\"Cui cited the phase one economic and trade agreement between China and the United States as evidence to dismiss the \"decoupling\" theory, and expressed hope that the deal will be \"implemented effectively,\" which he said is \"a big plus\" for overall China-U.S. relations.\"The good news is that we have concluded the phase one trade agreement. This is evidence that there's intention on both sides to solve our economic problem and maintain and develop our economic relations,\" Cui added.The China-U.S. phase one economic and trade agreement takes effect on Friday. As part of the agreement, the U.S. government agreed to cut additional tariffs on roughly 120 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese products from 15 percent to 7.5 percent, while China would also halve rates of additional tariffs on 75 billion dollars worth of U.S. products.",

            "As of now, China is the only country in the world which has brought a large-scale COVID-19 pandemic back under control.",
            "China did not have the same advantages that other nations had in formulating a response. By the time the COVID-19 virus had spread to Europe, the genetic code was already known. Because of the sharing of China's information on the virus, then the Europeans had some idea of the symptoms and the mechanism of transmission. Epidemiologists had a reasonable idea of how fast the virus can spread.",
            "Unlike China at the beginning of the outbreak, we the Europeans already had an essentially reliable method of screening to determine who has, and who has not, contracted the virus. We were presented with a trickle of cases at first, all coming originally from the same part of the world. China's decision to place Hubei Province into a lockdown ensured that the virus could not be exported in large numbers quickly, buying further time for research.",
            "Despite all of these advantages, the virus has still grown out of control in various countries around the world. It turns out that the COVID-19 disease is difficult to deal with. People are able to transmit it while they still have only mild symptoms. If we were to do nothing, then on average each sick person will infect three others  the \"basic reproductive number\" described by scientists.",
            "A significant proportion of patients require the use of respirators and provision of oxygen treatment. No country on the planet has enough intensive care beds to deal with a full-scale pandemic.",
            "Whilst the outbreak was initially confined to China, the Western media was savage in its criticism of China's actions. China's actions were described as \"draconian\", \"extreme\", and \"authoritarian\" but rarely as \"necessary\" or \"helpful\". The social impact of China's policy on citizens in Wuhan was significant. Nobody, not least the Chinese government, is disputing that. China does not claim that it got everything right in its response to the emerging threat.",
            "How could it possibly when nobody yet knew the necessary information to develop a strategy? Suddenly, without warning, the infrastructure of a single city was placed under enormous and unprecedented strain. Mistakes were made, and China has admitted them, but I'd defy any city in the world to cope with something like COVID-19 from a standing start.",
            "It was claimed that China was \"covering up\" a huge number of cases in Hubei Province. We now have some data that allows us to test whether that was actually true. A paper published by Imperial College London looked at 8,000 passengers on 30 flights out of Wuhan City, where every passenger was tested for the COVID-19 virus and then quarantined for 14 days.",
            "From that sample, they estimated that between 0.32 percent and 1.89 percent had the virus. Such figures aren't too different from the actual figures for Wuhan city. If China's numbers haven't identified every single person who would test positive, that is easily explained more by asymptomatic and mildly-symptomatic individuals not being tested. The evidence does not support a cover-up, but the narrative has taken hold in the West anyway.",
            "China's actions haven't been replicated by Western governments, either. No European country could build a new hospital in just 10 days; both domestic and EU legislation would prevent the actions necessary to achieve it.",
            "Governments couldn't insist upon attendance at dedicated quarantine centers. They realistically wouldn't have the authority to require officials to go door-to-door to ensure that isolation would be respected. Nor do they have the facial recognition software to be able to undertake contact tracing in such a systemic way.",
            "Because Western governments are unable to act in the same way, the reaction has been to criticize. Those who said China was too slow to respond in early January were claiming by February that China was over-reacting. In March, they are criticizing an \"autocratic\" Chinese government. None of that matters; what matters is stopping the virus in its tracks.",
            "Quarantine and isolation are different things. Isolation prevents a virus spreading. Quarantines almost inevitably mix sick people with some healthy people; the spread of the COVID-19 disease on the Diamond Princess is the prime example of that. China's decision to quarantine rather than merely isolate many people in Wuhan City was a difficult one, but it worked. The rest of the world would be in a much more difficult position today if it weren't for that quarantine.",
            "The situation has changed  a higher proportion of the population has now contracted the COVID-19 virus disease in Italy than in China  and China's outbreak is currently under control. Horrific mistakes have been made by government in Italy and in the U.S. Yet the Western media has largely not aimed the same level of criticism at those governments.",
            "I believe much of this is a long-standing cultural question, about the nature of China's government. The reasons for this are complex, but their words ring hollow, particularly when China is the only country to have beaten off a huge outbreak of the disease.",

            "On Thursday, March 5, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian urged the world community to lift sanctions on Iran to help its government and people's fight against novel coronavirus epidemic, noting that \"The continued imposition of unilateral sanctions on Iran is contrary to the spirit of humanitarianism.\"",
            "The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected almost each and every province in Iran. The number of patients has overwhelmed local resources, the virus is attacking the most vulnerable points of the national health system.",
            "Nearly 300,000 trained foot soldiers, volunteers, public health workers and specialists have been dispatched to outbreak regions up and down the country to identify people with this new infectious disease.",
            "The outbreak, one of the world's largest, is gathering pace and health workers are discovering previously existing cases. They are sanitizing homes, public places and surfaces that harbor the deadly virus. They have identified numerous potential cases and clusters of people with similar symptoms, all while quarantining the sick and exposed. By Friday, March 6, the number of infections had risen to over 4,700 with the death toll being 124.",
            "But avoid reading too much into those numbers as the severity of the crisis is bigger. It is commendable that Iran managed to identify its first cases after it received advanced test and diagnostic kits first from China and later from Europe.",
            "However, there aren't yet any vaccines or therapeutics and given the ongoing trade and banking restrictions imposed by the United States, the contagion will only get worse.",
            "Keep in mind that the shortages of advanced testing kits and other equipment contributed to an earlier under-count when there were no widespread testing. Amid the shortages, disruptions and supply-chain problems, Iran has become the hub of a major outbreak in the Middle East.",
            "Soon we will find out many more people have been infected as medical workers visit towns and villages in 31 provinces to conduct tests. They have this capacity and are cooperating with infectious disease experts from China and the World Health Organization. When hospitals and medical centers fall short  and if this happens not all patients will receive the necessary medical care  don't blame the experts. The manufacture of medical products in Iran depends on imported ingredients and materials and they have all been curtailed by sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies.",
            "How? For example, as a recent Foreign Policy article, entitled \"As coronavirus spreads in Iran, sanctions are making it worse,\" points out, although \"Iranian companies (produce) medicine, disinfectants, and protective clothing,\" their production relies on imported ingredients and materials. However, as the U.S. sanctions mean Iran's imports have become more reliant on its transport links with regional countries, in the wake of the increasing restrictions put in place by these countries on transportation with Iran, the supply of raw materials of ingredients to the country has taken a significant hit.",
            "Are the countries imposing sanctions on Iran not ashamed of their hard hearts? If they respond with genuine empathy and understanding, shame cannot survive. The epidemic is an unpleasant lesson in what happens when a country is unethically sanctioned in great violation of international norms and international human rights law.",
            "The laws and norms overlap greatly on this planet of ours, to the extent that they oblige all United Nations member states to respect and promote this mutually beneficial relationship, and in particular, to prevent a pandemic. Like other nations, the people of Iran have the universal right to health like all countries' citizens do. We have relevant health-related obligations per the international human rights law to contribute to this right.",
            "For all its importance, there is a limited window to fight the COVID-19 epidemic and Iran needs help from all governments. The world must be prepared for the reality that there will be more cases, especially in rural communities where people bear the brunt of the illnesses and where the virus is circulating fast while inventories in medical centers and hospitals are running low.",
            "It follows that by lifting the sanctions and not constraining the supply of raw materials and imported goods, the U.S. can still find its place in history. The hope is that the administration in Washington will take the necessary steps to change course and help Iran build an effective, integrated health system and response to the emerging disease.",
            "In collaboration with international partners, Iranian medical leaders and entities can address their vulnerabilities and provide more advanced test kits and quality health services to everyone affected by the disease on the front lines of the virus-hit provinces, and thereby doing their share to prevent a global pandemic.",

The patient, admitted to the hospital on February 19, was not diagnosed until February 23. The request to get him tested was denied repeatedly because he did not fit the existing CDC criteria for testing.",
            "Most labs follow a stringent criteria that the CDC set up to determine who could be tested. Before the first case of unknown origin was reported, only those who had traveled to China in the past 14 days of developing symptoms and those who had contact with coronavirus patients were eligible for testing.",
            "Data from the CDC shows that as of March 1, one in one million were tested for COVID-19 in the U.S. In comparison, in South Korea, it was 2,138 per million, and in Italy, 386 per million.",
            "The high bar set for COVID-19 testing meant that those with mild symptoms were denied access.

            "In the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak, only U.S. state public labs were allowed to conduct COVID-19 testing. Local hospitals, if they wanted to test for the virus, needed to validate their test with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a lengthy onerous process that is likely to take a few days.",

All samples were required to be sent to the central CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, which significantly delayed the diagnosis and treatment process.",

Darcy Burner, a businesswoman and politician in the Eastside suburbs of Seattle, wrote on Twitter that in her neighborhood, local hospital isolation rooms are full of COVID-19 patients who have not been reported.",
            "\"The people who aren't hospitalized are currently spreading the virus largely unchecked, and right now have no way to get tested,\" she wrote.",

            "Following the nation-wide call for more testing, and as the fear of community transmission increases, the CDC began shipping test kits to private labs across the country. Hundreds of academic hospital labs are authorized to offer coronavirus testing, while commercial companies are also encouraged to develop their own testing kits.",
            "2,500 test kits with a capacity of up to 500 tests each will be supplied to laboratories by the end of Friday, able to perform up to one million coronavirus tests, according to FDA CommissionerStephen Hahn.",
            "But as the availability of test kits increase, costs associated with the tests also become a problem. Those with medical insurance can have their testing cost covered just as other type of care. For tests conducted in public labs, no cost will be incurred. But as the CDC announced that it would work with commercial firms to expand testing, private companies may issue separate bills for the test.",
            "But even if testing is free, other associated costs may not be. The U.S. health care system has already come under fire in recent days for charging hefty bills for government-mandated quarantines. According to the New York Times report, among a dozen Americans flown back from Wuhan and quarantined in the U.S., one was charged for over 3,000 U.S. dollars for his hospital visit.",
            "For the 27.5 million uninsured in the U.S., they may have no choice but to foot an exorbitantly high medical bill, including costs of visiting the doctors' office and emergency room cost. The concern is that the uninsured would skip treatment for fear of its overwhelming cost and thus miss the chance for early treatment.",

There are now more calls for Congress to help fund local response and research for treatment for COVID-19.",
            "It is increasingly the case that the burdens of COVID-19 are falling disproportionately on those who are vulnerable because of their economic, social and health status. To remove the financial barrier for people to go and get screened at the hospital would be key to containing the spread of the virus."

            "The severe restrictions have become a necessary tool after the number of coronavirus infections jumped by almost 2,000 in just 24 hours leading to a total count of over 9,000 infected people and nearly 500 deaths.",
            "As a consequence, Italy officially has become the first country in the world entirely locked down and,according to the updated statistics,is the second most-affected country by number of deaths after China, overcoming Iran and South Korea. It is the forth most-affected by number of infected people behind China, South Korea and Iran.",
            "The decision taken during the weekend was aimed to immediately isolate the most-affected areas such as Lombardy region and other 14 provinces in Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, and quarantine people coming from \"red zones\"in order to avoid \"green zones\" from getting impacted.",
            "The unexpected reaction of the citizens of \"red zones\" at the announcement, posting dramatic images on social media showing the night exodus from Milan railway station heading to the south of Italy or long queues at famous ski locations, is just an example of how difficult it is in a modern democratic country to make people understand the risks that they can expose themselves to and to everyone else with their individual actions.",
            "In addition, violent protests have broken out in several Italian prisons due to the restrictions, with several prisoners requesting for an amnesty due to the high risk of contagion inside the overly crowded Italian prisons.",
            "It has to be said that the government has had a clear responsibility in creating a climate of confusion and panic by leading without a clear strategy and making decisions later abruptly overturned with contrary decisions.",
            "Many personalities in the government and in the media have for long remarked how a more drastic approach had become a necessity, frequently mentioning the example of China for its centralized approach and the necessity to use a tighter grip on citizens'behavior.",
            "In this sense, Italy's approach has been to simply copy and paste China-style measures such as checking people's body temperature, surveillingthe entry/exit to transportation and office complexes, closing schools and banning public events and adoption of smart work policies for companies.",
            "These are certainly good initiatives by the Italian government and represent a good start;but in my view,these measures alone cannot have the same impact as they are having in China because of the lack of scale and amount of resources that Italy can mobilize and because the two countries have totally different cultures at their cores.",
            "China is by nature a collectivist societyand in this sense,the government has a higher probability of success.",
            "On the contrary, Italy having at its core a Western-based value system is mainly an individualistic society where the interest of the person normally prevails on the general interest and this makes the job of the government in controlling citizens'behavior and coordinating actions more difficult and potentially unsuccessful.",
            "The key point here is that a more resolute approach of the Italian government is unquestionably welcome;but it cannot simply work by importing a policy or an approach that is successful in another country and think that it can have the same outcome.",
            "The Italian government's job is to try to change people's mindset and make them understand that now it's time to pause normal life habits and make sacrifices in order to go through the storm all together.",
            "The decisions made by the Italian government could be certainly unpopular among the citizens and could even have a boomerang effect on the coalition in power in case of new political elections in the autumn of this year. But desperate times call for desperate measures and the health of people must have the absolute priority over the egoism of individual choices.",

            "Videos of people fighting in supermarkets went viral over the weekend as customers across the world began panic buying amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The virus, which has now killed more than 4,000 people and infected more than 110,000, has led to panic buying, empty shelves and tension at supermarket checkouts as nervous shoppers have stocked up on canned goods, non-perishables and cleaning products. Consumer psychologist Phillip Graves, told CGTN Europe that the situation was a \"perfect storm\" for panic buying. Amid the outbreak, accelerated by media reports, \"people are having their attention drawn to certain items, they're hearing that people are panic buying and they're going into shops, seeing that there are spaces on the shelves. All of that tends to fan the flames,\" Graves explained.The phenomena has lead to UK supermarkets rationing certain goods including toilet paper to prevent panicked customers stockpiling.",
            "For Graves there is an explanation behind the toilet paper rush. \"It becomes a product that everybody thinks about buying on every single trip. That, combined with the fact that it's very conspicuous when people are buying it, because it's a bulky item and when it's not on the shelves ... people have a very strong sense that it is being bought by lots of other people.\" In the UK, panic buying has got so bad that the country's prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the public to follow scientific advice, adding: \"There isn't any need for people to buy stuff in.\" Despite the government's advice, panic buying is hard to stop  much like the way a virus can spread across a society, accelerated by our \"innate responses,\" explained Grave. \"We know that the human mind is involved with this tempering force of loss aversion. To help us make, in inverted commas, 'better decisions', decisions that are more likely to help us survive in our evolutionary past. And what we're seeing is, if you like, the evolutionary brain played out in this particular set of circumstances,\" he said."

            "Italy is suspending all sporting activity until at least April 3 in a sweeping effort to contain a worsening COVID-19 outbreak.The country's prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced at a press conference late on Monday that restrictions on travel and public gatherings, initially imposed on northern regions, had been extended to cover the entire country. Under the new measures, all public events will be banned; cinemas, theaters, gyms, discos and pubs closed; and funerals, weddings and sporting events canceled.The drastic decision to put all domestic sport on hold comes after a meeting between Italy's Olympic Committee (CONI) chief Giovanni Malago, the body's Secretary General Carlo Mornati and members of Italy's sporting federations at the committee's headquarters in Rome.Saying that \"health protection is the absolute priority of all,\" CONI said in a statement that \"all sports activities at all levels be suspended until April 3, 2020.\"\"International competitions, both for clubs and national teams, do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Italian National Olympic Committee and therefore cannot be regulated by today's decisions.\"",
            "It was also confirmed on Monday that Serie A side Roma's Europa League tie at Sevilla on Thursday will be played behind closed doors.Meanwhile, French Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu told a press conference on Monday that all French top flight football matches will be played behind closed doors or with a maximum attendance of 1,000 people until April 15 due to the coronavirus outbreak.Paris police announced on Monday that Ligue 1 giants Paris St-Germain's Champions League last-16 clash with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday will be played without fans.PSG, who would have expected a full house of more than 45,000 fans at the Parc des Princes for the game, issued a statement of their own, saying: \"In this context, the club remains fully mobilized to organize the match in the best possible conditions.\"The announcement was closely followed by the postponement of the Six Nations rugby match between France and Ireland scheduled for Saturday in Paris. They are the highest profile sporting events in France to be hit by the coronavirus outbreak.Maracineanu said that the final matches of an ongoing four-team women's international football tournament involving France, the Netherlands, Brazil and Canada will also be played behind closed doors on Tuesday.",

The announcement came a few hours after the Balkan country confirmed its first cases of coronavirus.The British government has declined to take similar measures, saying it currently had no plans to cancel or close off sporting events due to the epidemic, after meeting sports bodies and broadcasters on Monday.",
            "Britain's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport revealed that there had been discussion of contingency plans to cancel events or stage them behind closed doors \"should the situation change and become necessary.\"\"However, based upon the current scientific advice from the government's medical experts, there is no rationale to close or cancel sporting events as things stand,\" it said.Earlier, UK Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden also played down the virus threat in an interview with the BBC, saying \"At this stage we're not in the territory of cancelling or postponing events.\"\"I was at Twickenham [for England v Wales] with the prime minister. There was a huge crowd of people there. There is no reason why people should not be going to those events. It is very premature to be talking about things like that.\"\"I do want to emphasis in relation to sporting events, any talk of cancellation is very premature indeed. At the moment, there is no evidence to suggest we should be doing that and we don't have any plans to,\" he added.(With input from agencies)"

            "Despite the initial mismanagement by the local government, once the news of the disease emerged, the central government took swift action. It began with an unprecedented meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on the first day of the Lunar New Year, chaired by Xi, also secretary general of CPC Central Committee. A leading group was established at the meeting at the country's top level leadership to command the nationwide battle against the coronavirus.",

Military personnel were airlifted into Wuhan to provide support on the ground. They were given the authority over Huoshenshan Hospital, the facility in charge of caring for COVID-19 patients, and military medical staff stood on the front line against the disease.",

President Xi was firm in his belief to isolate the source of the problem and take in all patients for medical care. Even as the country is on the path towards normalization and full recovery, strict travel restrictions and monitoring systems are still in place to prevent the recurrence of the outbreak. Medical supplies and daily necessities are in storage and ready to be shipped to places under lockdown in a quick notice.",

The WHO has said that China's actions are the only ones with proven record of success in combating COVID-19 and has praised the country for the tough decisions it has taken. With cases surging across the globe, many countries are now following China's steps to centralize the command structure within their government and shutting down towns and cities to prevent the spread of the disease.",

            "Despite having fewer customers, Yao is busier than usual since it takes longer to take body temperatures, disinfect the packages and consult with customers over designated delivery times and locations. \"All the residential compounds in this neighborhood are on partial lockdown, blocking entrances to couriers and leaving only one gate open for residents to come out to pick up their orders,\" Yao said. The \"no-touch delivery\" measure was introduced by Alibaba and other online retailers to help contain the spread of the coronavirus.",
            "That measure, however, barely alleviates the concerns of delivery riders such as Yao. After all, they have to come into contact with numerous goods headed for dozens of communities every day. \"I'm not fearless, especially since my running around puts my three-year-old kid at risk of catching the virus. My parents would call every day to make sure we're doing okay,\" Yao said. \"But I cannot leave my customers hanging. Unlike those living in real villages, they don't have cropland of their own, so they would have difficulty getting food and other essentials as restaurants and supermarkets stay closed.\"",
            "Plus, the delivery service could help people stay indoors, away from crowded public spaces. That's something Yao's proud of. He feels like he's contributing to society in his own way during this seemingly desolate winter.",
            "A home away from home",
            "Another motivation driving Yao to brave the coronavirus outbreak is the fact that he's the one to bring home the bacon. His wife Yang Na quit her waitressing job years ago and left Beijing to return to Yao's hometown, where the living costs are much lower. They've opted for a long-distance relationship to ease their family's financial burden.",
            "Yang visited her husband in the Chinese capital with their son days before the Spring Festival, hoping that Yao would take them to some scenic spots before they head home together in central China's Henan Province on January 31, when a second wave of couriers at the station would take time off for the holiday. But the escalating outbreak has derailed that plan. The first batch of delivery workers who had returned to their hometowns were stranded, so the second wave  and therefore Yao  couldn't leave.",
            "\"We now have seven workers providing service for the neighborhood. Three are stuck due to road closures and one has resigned,\" said Wang Pan, head of the Xiaowuji station. He had gone home in east China's Shandong Province for the holiday but volunteered to come back on January 26  the second day of the first lunar month. \"As fear spread along with the coronavirus, I decided to come back to set the couriers at ease. During the outbreak, they play more important roles than ever,\" Wang noted. In addition, most delivery workers are the sole breadwinners of their families, so they can't afford to lose customers they've spent a long time building relationships with.",
            "\"Some customers are pissed off at us for failing to bring their orders right to them, but more people have grown more understanding,\" said Yao. \"Once an octogenarian ordered six big cases of water, but his residential community didn't allow me in because of the new regulation. I explained that he was too old to carry the water from the community entrance to his condo and the security guards let me in. When I carried the water into his condo, his caretaker gave me an apple, a drink, and a mask and asked me to take care of myself. At that moment, I felt that my efforts were worth it.\"",
            "Someone's gone, someone knocked",
            "Not everyone has as much courage as Yao. One of his longtime colleagues quit late last month for fear of getting infected though the company has equipped the delivery workers with full protective gear including masks, goggles and hand sanitizers. The panic will probably cause more to leave this frontline profession, for working under the fear of contracting the virus adds to the already immense stress from the job.",
            "\"Over this Spring Festival holiday, we've received twice as many orders as those in the year before, most of the orders being daily staples like rice, flour, cooking oil and water. And the daily orders have increased by 10 percent compared with previous months,\" Wang told us. Facing the staffing shortage, he started posting job advertisements.",
            "By the time he had told us about the concern, a man showed up at the doorstep: \"Do you need a deliveryman?",

            "An economic recession?",
            "This fear became paramount when WHO designated the coronavirus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Groundless rhetoric glutted social media platforms that a PHEIC label would isolate the Chinese economy and hence lead to an economic recession which could be worse than the consequences of the China-U.S. trade war. \"My company can only sustain for two more months,\" a private firm owner said. There was a scarier \"prediction\": \"The Chinese economy will go back to 20 years ago!\"",
            "\"There's no denying that the Chinese economy will be affected, in particular because in the troika of investment, export and consumption  the first two have been dealt a blow given the spread of the coronavirus. Plus, consumption is losing steam as the service sector is being hit,\" said Jiang Rushan, an Asia studies fellow to Harvard Kennedy School, during a phone interview with CGTN.",
            "Though the production chain has been interrupted with employees failing to come back to work as scheduled and impeded logistics operations, China has a supply stock that can be sustained for quite a while, Jiang said. \"China's economy will likely see a robust rebound in the latter half of the year.\"",
            "Li Yi has a more nuanced observation. The visiting scholar to the National Autonomous University of Mexico calls on people to stay composed while remaining at home. \"WHO gave the first PHEIC tag to the H1N1 influenza that broke out in Mexico and the southern U.S. states of Texas and Florida in 2009, but the U.S. economy was not as hurt as expected,\" he told CGTN. Back then, the tourism sector in the U.S. remained bloated, and the flagging trade figures were more of a result of the financial crisis that originated in the country the previous year.",
            "\"Mexico's travel statistics in 2009 were bleak, but we have to know that the U.S. was the main source country of tourists to Mexico. With strained income due to the financial crisis, American tourists refrained from unnecessary trips,\" Li said.",
            "Brazil offers a more pertinent example. In 2016, the Zika virus ravaged the largest country in Latin America, which was embroiled in an abyss of political turmoil. The virus was also designated a PHEIC by WHO, coming at an inopportune time as the upcoming Olympics were to be held in Rio de Janeiro - but doomsday predictions of the disease on its domestic economy didn't come true. The GDP even rose in 2017 after the end of Zika, after years of decline.",
            "In times of crisis, it is easy to treat a country or people as scapegoat for something that is beyond their control. For this disease outbreak, paranoia stemming from misinformation and ingrained biases only fans tension. Instead, preventive measures should continue to be taken, and support given to health professionals and others who are actively working to battle this epidemic."

            "At the same time, major battles against the virus have been continuing in China. While the war against this outbreak is not yet over, the experience of China has already offered some key lessons for the world. It is now necessary to think clearly and act decisively in each country affected by the virus, as well as at the international level.",
            "This is not the time for media speculation, politicization and panic. The coronavirus disease is akin to a natural disaster with global effects, requiring serious actions by governments and responsible discussion in the media.",

In the past days, these experiences were explained most eloquently by Dr. Bruce Aylward, team lead of the WHO-China joint mission on COVID-19, who returned from China recently.",
            "Aylward reported that in Wuhan, which was the first place hit by the virus, the peak seems to have been passed and that the disease is in sharp decline. In addition, he conveyed the key messages, important for an understanding of the struggle against the virus in China. They included the main lessons to be internalized by policymakers everywhere in the world when confronted with this decentralized epidemic.",

            "First, adjust your mindset. It is important to understand that the virus can strike anywhere and soon. This must not lead to panic but to preparedness for resolute response. When the virus hits, it has to be stopped  and stopped as close as possible to the place where it occurred.",
            "Second, work with the people. People should be prepared for the virus and explained that an organized and disciplined action is absolutely necessary. People should not neglect the basic precautions such as frequent washing of hands and covering coughs.",
            "Experienced epidemiologists know that people behave rationally when they are intellectually and emotionally prepared for the possible outbreaks.",

Good organization, an effective assistance to people showing the symptoms of COVID-19, good organization of separate spaces for patients and ensuring adequate protection gear and equipment for the health workers and health institutions are among the key conditions for successful fighting the virus.",

            "Success in the fighting the COVID-19 will deepen the understanding of the need for quality development that will be needed for further progress and economic performance of China. Development of the health care system is an essential part of quality development.",
            "At the same time, the current stage of war against the coronavirus disease puts three tests before the political leaders everywhere in the world:",
            "The first test relates to the task to adjust the mindset of the political leaders themselves to the need to act decisively and to lead the people in a manner that strengthens solidarity. The political leaders who like to emphasize their \"values based\" policies will have to show their ability to lead in a crisis situation in a manner that actually respects and upholds such basic human values like the right to life and the right to the highest attainable standard of health.",
            "The experience of China should help them to make the right decisions in a timely fashion and to avoid mistakes that usually happen in the early phases of an emergency.",
            "The second test is one of international solidarity. Not all of the countries of the world are prepared to cope with an outbreak like the current COVID-19. There might be a need to help with technical assistance, medical personnel and equipment.",
            "And again, the experience of China and the experience of cooperation between different Chinese provinces could help. Naturally, it is more difficult to organize effective assistance internationally than within a single country  even if that country is as large and diverse as China. But the basic principle of solidarity is the same.",
            "This week the EU has decided to devote significant funds for assistance to countries in the world that need assistance in equipment and personnel. This is a good sign to be followed by effective action  wherever needed.",
            "And the third and final test relates to global cooperation. There is much discussion about multilateralism in the world these days. It should be clear that multilateral cooperation in fighting the coronavirus disease is an important test for the international community as a whole. The World Health Organization is showing the way.",
            "The United Nations is developing its inter-agency, system wide activation procedures which should help in the current and future emergencies. All member states of the United Nations and all parts of the UN system must be engaged. This is not about public health \"only.\" This is a critical test of multilateralism and of the ability of the world to move towards a shared future  a better future for all.",

            "Black Monday returned after 32 years when the Dow Jones industrial average ended the opening day down more than 2,000 points and Wall Street triggered an automated circuit breaker that put trading to a halt. The massive rout triggered by the coronavirus panic swept from London to Tokyo.",
            "In addition to the dramatic financial volatility, the spread of the coronavirus led the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to cut the 2020 global growth to as low as 1.5 percent. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a recession will occur if global growth falls below 2.5 percent a year.",
            "With confirmed coronavirus cases soaring past 110,000 globally, it's difficult to predict the exact losses to the already slowing economy. But a closer look at how epidemics throughout history affected the economy may shed light on the current situation.",
            "Black Death",
            "The Black Death ravaged 14th century Europe as one of the most catastrophic pandemics in recorded history, claiming 75 to 200 million lives in Eurasia. The loss of manpower, somewhere between a third to a half of the European population, greatly changed the medieval agricultural economy, preluding a transition from a commercial revolution to \"modern capitalism,\" according to many economists.",
            "Farmers went from growing grain to cultivating cash crops and raising livestock. Meanwhile, rising wages led to more spending and hence enriched layers of trade networks, which in turn precipitated the invention of industrial machines to meet growing consumption.",
            "Accounting, banking and credit systems also started to modernize at the time to facilitate investment. With market prosperity came economic expansion and an integration of markets.",
            "Spanish flu",
            "As European nations clashed in WWI, governments censored news related to the spread of a deadly influenza virus to avoid affecting the morale of troops fighting during the decisive phase of the war. Spain's neutrality in the conflict allowed reports of the epidemic to surface, which gave the impression that the virus originated in the country, hence the misnomer \"Spanish flu.\"",
            "In one of the deadliest pandemics in history, the influenza of 1918 infected one quarter of the world population and wiped out tens of millions of people  more than the total number of deaths from the war at the time.",
            "Despite its horrendous death toll, the influenza only inflicted a sharp but temporary decline in global economic activity, according to analysis by the IMF. However, this could be due to the wartime preparedness of the countries involved and wouldn't necessarily apply in the peaceful circumstances of today.",
            "As the U.S. joined the war in 1917, massive federal spending was unleashed to support the war effort. Factories switched from producing civilian to military goods while unemployment dropped from 7.9 percent to 1.4 percent as young men from across the country enlisted in the military. As a result, the annual output loss was only 0.4 percent despite the incredible devastation caused by the influenza, according to a study by the Canadian Department of Finance.",
            "Attempts to uncover the real economic consequences of a large-scale pandemic focused on the experience of Sweden  a neutral country during WWI that was nonetheless struck by the 1918 influenza. Joint research conducted by several universities in Europe concluded that the pandemic appeared to lead to a large increase in poverty rates. A 2006 study published in the Journal of Political Economy also found that fetuses conceived during the 1918 influenza showed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, as well as lower income and socioeconomic status.",
            "H1N1 influenza",
            "The outbreak of the swine flu, or H1N1 influenza, in 2009 caused great alarm at the time. The strain was different from but related to the Spanish flu of 1918 that had killed tens of millions. Experts estimated that the virus in 2009 killed hundreds of thousands in its first year, which made it less deadly, but it still dented the economies of the U.S. and Latin America.",
            "Though direct economic impacts from an epidemic are difficult to model, especially when much of the global economy was in the midst of the Great Recession, certain indicators show that particular industries were negatively affected. Mexico lost almost a million visitors during that time over a five-month period, incurring estimated losses of 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in tourism. Its pork industry didn't fare so well either. Since the country is a major exporter of the meat, trade partners such as China worried about the spread of the swine flu halted imports, a ban that ended only in 2018. By the end of 2009, Mexico's pork trade deficit reached 27 million U.S. dollars.",
            "Socioeconomic burdens more directly related to the disease also attest to the impact of the epidemic. In South Korea, the 2009 H1N1 influenza infected over 3 million people, translating to 1.09 billion U.S. dollars, about 60 percent of which were medical costs. Other costs included lost wages, especially for men, who earned more than women.",
            "The financial burden suffered by the United States can directly be measured by how much money was set aside by the government to fight pandemic flu in 2009, which included H1N1. Congress allocated 7.65 billion U.S. dollars for that purpose. CDC notes that about one million Americans were infected, with 600 deaths.",
            "Now with COVID-19 running rampant, the FTSE100 and Nikkei suffered the worst day since 2008, causing people to worry that the novel coronavirus may take an economic toll like previous pandemics. The gloomy sentiment is, in a sense, well founded. Less than a week ago, the 10-year Treasury yields tumbled below 1 percent  the first time in 150 years since the introduction of the economic benchmark in 1871. And it seems that protective measures against panicked selling en masse fell through this time.",
            "\"But this phenomenon is not only related to coronavirus fears but also owing to some fundamental problems in the world's largest economy  prohibitive debts, tax cuts, which further aggravate the debt problems, and financial bubbles,\" Wang Yong, director of the Center for International Political Economy at Peking University, told CGTN.",
            "There might be a cost to the world real economy in the short term, with supply chains being hit, consumption shrinking and tourism faltering. Plus, \"the disease will probably disrupt the cash flow of companies,\" said Jia Jinjing, director of Macroeconomic Research of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. According to Jia, the economy will weather the turbulence and people will have their basic needs met, but unemployment rate might see a slight increase.",
            "Wang noted that today's world is more globalized and advanced than ever before, and more new technologies will emerge to tackle the crisis. As long as countries affected take effective control measures, the coronavirus alone will have little far-reaching economic repercussions.",

Through molecular biological detection, the researchers found out that the positive rate of the  coronavirus in pangolins is 70 percent.Researchers then conducted viral isolation and identification. The results of the analysis of genome of the virus showed that the sequences of the isolated virus strains were 99 percent similar to those currently infecting humans.Professor Shen Yongyi, one of the researchers from South China Agricultural University, said in a press conference on Friday that pangolins might not be the only potential intermediate host of the virus.\"Take SARS as an example, besides civets, other small carnivores might also amplify the spread of the virus,\" Shen said.The university said that the research is vital for the prevention and control of the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.\"Based on the severe condition of epidemic prevention and control, we decided to release our research results as soon as possible,\" Liu Yahong, president of South China Agricultural University and executive deputy director of Lingnan Guangdong Laboratory of Modern Agriculture, said during the press conference.",

It was unnecessary.\"The sources said the National Security Council (NSC), which advises the president on security issues, ordered the classification. \"This came directly from the White House,\" one official said.The White House insistence on secrecy at the nation's premier public health organization, which has not been previously disclosed, has put a lid on certain information  and potentially delayed the response to the crisis. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed about 30 people in the United States and infected more than 1,000 people.",
            "HHS oversees a broad range of health agencies, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which among other things is responsible for tracking cases and providing guidance nationally on the outbreaks.The administration officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said they could not describe the interactions in the meeting room because they were classified.An NSC spokesman did not respond to questions about the meetings at HHS. But he defended the administration's transparency across federal agencies and noted that meetings of the administration's task force on the coronavirus all are unclassified. It was not immediately clear which meetings he was referring to.\"From day one of the response to the coronavirus, NSC has insisted on the principle of radical transparency,\" said the spokesman, John Ullyot. He added that the administration \"has cut red tape and set the global standard in protecting the American people under President Trump's leadership.\"A spokeswoman for HHS, Katherine McKeogh, issued a statement that did not address questions about classified meetings. Using language that echoed the NSC's, the department said it that it agreed task-force meetings should be unclassified.",
            "Critics have hammered the Trump administration for what they see as a delayed response to coronavirus outbreaks and a lack of transparency, including sidelining experts and providing misleading or incomplete information to the public. State and local officials also have complained of being kept in the dark about essential federal response information.U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, the administration's point person on coronavirus, vowed on March 3 to offer \"real-time information in a steady pace and be fully transparent.\" After days of downplaying the threat of the outbreak, Trump was considering a national disaster declaration and new travel advisories while Congress unveiled a multi-billion dollar coronavirus aid package Wednesday as Washington raced to confront COVID-19.Trump announced he would be delivering a prime-time Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday at 9 p.m. on the federal response to what is now the coronavirus pandemic."

Professor Bert Hofman, former World Bank Country Director for China, an insightful China-watcher for years, shares his perspective on this.",

How effective will these measures be?",

Many have gotten bored of confinement after being compelled to work from home or even tired of the stringent sanitation and disinfection practices implemented across the country.",
            "However, if one is to believe Fionn Wright, an avid China watcher, these changes that people are experiencing in their private lives along with the larger prevention and control measures put in place by the government will ensure China's rise as a much stronger nation after the epidemic, now officially known as COVID-19, is curbed.",
            "\"There's a concept in China   (sai weng shi ma, yan zhi fei fu)  and essentially it means that something that might look bad [in first sight] may actually turn out to be a good thing. And that's what I'm seeing with this coronavirus outbreak,\" Wright, a Shanghai-based Irish expat who divides his time between China and Canada, told CGTN Digital in a Skype interview from Vancouver.",
            "\"Right now, it seems like it could only be negative and it is a tragedy  the economy is hit hard, there are people suffering  but it might actually turn out to be positive; to be beneficial for the country in the long run,\" he added.",

            "Wright cited 10 trends  broadly categorized under the three fields of internet ecosystem, social shifts and government interventions  that are consolidating during the present crisis and could pave the way for, what he described as, a much more resilient \"China 2.0\" in the future.",
            "\"China 2.0 is the idea that China is moving towards something new. Now it's accelerating because of this coronavirus. It's had a bit of a dip now, a bit of a hit to the economy, but it's going to start accelerating now towards what I'm calling China 2.0,\" he said, explaining that the foundation for China 2.0 lies in realizing Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision of Community of Common Destiny.",
            "\"The way I prefer to translate it (Xi's vision) is thinking about it in terms of a species that is coming together and working towards a common vision of creating a harmonious world.  So, China 2.0 is also about World 2.0,\" he elaborated.",
            "Here's a low-down on the 10 trends amid the battle against COVID-19 that indicate the advent of China 2.0.",
            "1. Offline shopping will become 'experiential'",
            "Wright noted that the current situation is allowing online shopping, which is certainly not a new concept in China, to spread in areas where it didn't have much foothold earlier, such as in the case of groceries. \"During this outbreak, people had to stay at home. They couldn't go out. So, what happened was they started to buy the groceries online. So now it's become normal,\" he remarked.",
            "In the future, offline stores will become less about selling things and more about creating experiences, Wright insisted. \"We will still have physical stores, but people will visit to have these experiences. Instead of going to the till and buying something, they will scan a QR code and the item will be delivered to their house. So, we're going to see experiential stores tying in with new retail; how the whole internet ecosystem ties to the offline.\"",
            "2. Growth in online education",
            "With the Chinese New Year holidays extended for an indefinite period post the outbreak, schools and universities have resorted to online education at a large scale. Wright predicted that this will lead to \"entirely new models of online education and learning\" that could cater to a diverse group of students.",
            "\"So, you could have thousands of people attending a lecture by the best professor in China in a given subject; and at the same time, you could also see individual students or smaller groups of 6-10 students getting a tutor online,\" he said.",
            "3. Working from home will be the norm",
            "Wright asserted that the current situation will make organizations and individuals more receptive to remote working in the virtual sphere. \"At first it's always a bit strange, but now we have actually been pushed into this situation where you have to stay at home, but we still have to get our work done,\" he said.",
            "\"So, it's going to create over the next few months and years entirely new models of online collaboration  collaboration in the form of applications; in the form of how you set up an online office etc. Can you have an online receptionist? How do you organize things online? How do we manage projects online? These are all going to become much more sophisticated and innovative,\" he elucidated.",
            "4. Health conscious society based on biotech",
            "The transformation towards an increasingly health conscious society will be one of the major social shifts that China is expected to witness in the coming years, and biotech will play a key role in that direction, according to Wright.",
            "\"Food safety in China has already been a big question, but it's now going to be an even bigger priority. People are going to make sure they're eating safe food. And we're also going to see some of the bio-technologies are really going to expand. We're going to see entirely new ways of integrating medicine with society,\" he said.",
            "5. Accelerated integration of smart cities",
            "China already has more smart cities than the rest of the world combined. The novel coronavirus has seen authorities in various Chinese cities employing some of the latest smart AI technologies, including drones, infrared cameras and robots, in prevention and control measures. Wright maintained that these efforts will expedite the process of integration between the smart cities in ways that \"have never been seen in the history of humanity.\"",
            "\"We've seen drones flying around different cities in China, recommending people, you know, to make sure that they're wearing their masks, reminding them to be safe, reminding them not to spend too much time outdoors. We've also seen these infrared cameras that can detect in the crowd which person might have a fever. ... And we've already seen those maps across China where you can monitor who's sick where and ensure that you're in a safe environment.\"",
            "6. Next-level 'China speed'",
            "China has a formidable track record when it comes to the pace of development  creating infrastructures, highways, railway networks, hospitals and other facilities in record time. The unprecedented manner in which the system has responded to the current crisis shows a new level of \"China-speed.\"",
            "\"One of the things that's happened during this coronavirus outbreak is we've had the government working with companies, working with the average person to make sure that everyone's working together to deal with the challenge. So, we're going to see China's speed also in terms of strategic coordination, strategic resource allocation across different tiers, different layers of society to where the resources need to go,\" he remarked.",
            "7. Contingency plans for contingency plans",
            "The remarkable alacrity displayed in government intervention to overcome one of the biggest crises faced by China in recent decades has come for a lot of praise globally. The measures taken over the past weeks have shown that government is constantly working on multiple plans.",
            "\"We've known for quite a while that the Chinese government thinks many steps ahead and they've always tried to figure out what's the best way of doing things. They have contingency plans. But what we're going to start seeing now is they're going to have contingency plans for their contingency plans,\" Wright suggested, adding, \"We're really going to see how they can map out all the different scenarios and see what's the best way of responding and creating structures, creating systems to be able to respond in the most effective way.\"",
            "8. Consolidation of internal stability",
            "One of the key policy priorities for China is to maintain internal stability and sustainability. The coronavirus crisis will consolidate but also redefine the concept of stability for the entire population.",
            "\"Before the outbreak happened, China's internal stability had a lot to do with stable employment ... and with real estate, making sure that people are buying homes and not just buying properties for investment. Now after the outbreak, we're going to see that this internal stability has to do with the feeling in the country, this feeling of unity, this feeling of people coming together and working towards a common goal,\" Wright reasoned.",
            "9. Chinese firms push to expand abroad",
            "Amid reports of several firms halting or reducing productions across the country in the wake of the outbreak, Wright predicted a greater push by Chinese firms for overseas expansion in the future \"to diversify their markets the same way a wise investor diversifies his portfolio to dampen the effect of a crisis.\"",
            "\"This is really just a smart strategy. Right now, everything in China is shut down. If your company only operates in China, you haven't been able to do much. But if you're expanded across the world, then it doesn't really matter as much. You can still continue your operations around the world,\" he said.",
            "10. The 'China Dream' is just getting started",
            "Wright, a personal coach for entrepreneurs and executives who promises to fulfill your \"China Dream\" according to his LinkedIn profile, is convinced that the current crisis will only see the entire nation rebounding with full vigor to achieve that dream.",
            "\"The Chinese government has been pushing towards the vision of creating a moderately prosperous nation by 2020. In my estimation, they've already done that but they're going to push till the end of 2020 to make sure that they've hit all the goals of 'China Dream' that they wanted to hit,\" he said.",
            "\"I believe the coronavirus outbreak will end up creating solidarity within the nation, a unity within the nation to move forward together, to hit that vision,\" he concluded.",

            "While the World Health Organization (WHO) is organizing an international panel of experts to work with their Chinese counterparts in the upcoming days to address the outbreak, its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted early Thursday that he will reconvene an emergency meeting to determine whether to label the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).",
            "This will be the third meeting of its kind mulling over designating the novel coronavirus a global health emergency. At the previous two meetings, on January 22 and 23, WHO stopped short of declaring the virus a PHEIC.",
            "Read more: Over 7700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in China, 170 dead",
            "What constitutes a PHEIC?",
            "Since WHO revised the International Health Regulation (IHR) in 2005  much of it in response to the lack of a global system to address the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, only five outbreaks have been designated as PHEIC: the H1N1 influenza (2009), Poliomyelitis (2014), the Ebola virus in West Africa (2014), the Zika virus in Brazil (2016), and the latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2018.",
            "The IHR defines a PHEIC as \"an extraordinary event that poses a public health risk to other countries through international spread and that potentially requires a coordinated international response.\" It's a \"serious, unusual or unexpected\" situation that has gone beyond a country's border.",
            "Then how do officials decide how serious the transmission of a disease has to be before it is an international public health emergency? After all, the equally headline-grabbing MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2015 did not receive the designation. MERS is also caused by a coronavirus, albeit a different strain. Back then, the WHO said the main reason for not designating MERS as a PHEIC is the lack of evidence showing it had the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission.",
            "Under the IHR, the WHO can declare a PHEIC if two of the following four criteria are met: 1) The public health impact is serious; 2) The event is unusual or unexpected; 3) There is a significant risk of international spread; 4) There is a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions.",
            "If the disease is labeled as a PHEIC, then relevant countries must assess its public health risks within 48 hours. After that, if national authorities determine that the event meets their basic criteria, they must notify WHO within 24 hours.",
            "What follows such a designation is that the WHO can call for more resources to be directed to local response efforts, as well as coordinate international restrictions on travel and other measures.",
            "If the WHO decides to call the novel coronavirus a PHEIC, it would put the disease originating in central China's Wuhan in the same category as the Ebola virus and the Zika virus outbreaks.",
            "How will this designation change things?",
            "Every virus outbreak causes tremendous economic losses. Pandemics knock on average 0.7 percent of the annual global GDP, or 570 billion U.S. dollars, a threat similar in scale to that estimated for climate change in the coming decades, according to a joint study by the World Economic Forum and the Harvard Global Health Institute. The scenario would only be worse if the virus is declared a PHEIC.",
            "With such a label comes the concern that potential restrictions on trade and travel would severely impact the local economy. One year after the Ebola epidemic in 2014, the World Bank estimated that Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone  the three African countries that were hit the hardest  would lose at least 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in forgone economic growth, or over 12 percent of their combined GDP.",
            "The Spring Festival holiday in China is still ongoing. Hundreds of millions of Chinese have taken trains or flown home for a week or two. It's also a time to buy gifts for family members that have long been apart, or going out to restaurants to dine. The uncharacteristically empty streets this year as a result of the coronavirus and the panic it has caused would likely dent the usually robust spending by many Chinese during the festive season. Shopping malls are closing early and tourist attractions have been shuttered.",
            "Globally, a number of airlines have stopped flights to China and cruise lines nixed upcoming voyages. Every day news emerges that more multinationals are halting their businesses in various Chinese cities. Starbucks has closed over half of its store across the country; Disney has shut down its its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong; Uniqlo has closed some 100 stores in Hubei Province  the ground zero of the outbreak.",

            "It is difficult to imagine how a PHEIC label could exacerbate the economic outlook not only in the world's second-largest economy but also the rest of the world.",
            "Of course, safety is paramount at this time. During the MERS outbreak in 2015, WHO advised against traveling to affected areas in the Middle East, to where the origin of the coronavirus was traced, amid the pilgrimage season in Islam.",
            "As new statistics pour out on a daily basis, the Wuhan coronavirus sees little signs of abating for now. Although the economy is important, a strong international response should be welcomed if it can contain disease transmission and mitigate risk factors.

So, let's look at the facts.",

Comparing this with other countries on the same day, South Korea had tested more than 100,000 people with an average of 15,000 people each day. The UK has already tested almost 25,000 people.To make matters worse, many states have refused to release testing data and are only publishing confirmed cases. Test eligibility is also a major issue. In many states, public health departments refused to test people, unless they have been hospitalized or have traveled to China.But Trump seems to believe the current system is working rather well: \"But as of right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test  that's the important thing. And the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect; the transcription was perfect, right?\" (The transcription of a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that set Trump's impeachment in motion.)",
            "A lot of questions are also being asked over how authorities are handling confirmed patients.During an interview with CGTN, Tom Panocha, one of the COVID-19 survivors said: \"After my wife's testing results came back positive, they asked me to be tested. And they didn't ask me to do anything other than my normal activity so I continued to work. And then five days after I got tested, I was found to be positive.\"Last month, the White House gagged government health officials and scientists from speaking about the outbreak without the approval of Vice President Mike Pence. As cases continue to rise, Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders decided to cancel their election rallies on Tuesday but Trump still remains non-committal, days after refusing to back down.\"We'll have tremendous rallies and we're doing very well and we've done a fantastic job with respect to that subject on the virus,\" he added.Given the situation, experts believe patients with possible symptoms are being left to fend for themselves. Also, they fear the virus is being allowed to fester and spread across the country as the Trump administration continues playing catch-up."

Under the hashtag #CostcoPanicBuying, social media users have been sharing photos of empty aisles at their local supermarket. Scenes of chaos on shop floors and queues filling up parking lots have made international headlines.",
            "Costco saidits February sales increased by 13.8 percent over the same period in the previous year due to \"concerns over the coronavirus.\" Retailers and pharmacies everywhere are struggling to keep hand sanitizers, face masks and disinfectant wipes on the shelves, with some reportedly having to ration sanitizers and cold and flu-related items per customer. Other items in high demand include toilet paper, bottled water and canned goods, all of which are being grabbed up in bulk.",

The article reflects the author's views, and not necessarily those of CGTN.",
            "The panic generated by the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov, which originated in Wuhan, one of China's largest cities and a major domestic transport hub, reminds many of the fear and uncertainty at the peak of the 2003 SARS. China's stock market, after rising for months, has reversed itself in recent days, and global markets have followed suit, apparently reflecting concerns about the coronavirus's impact on the Chinese economy and global growth. Are these worries justified?",
            "My baseline projection is that the coronavirus outbreak will get worse before it gets better, with infections and deaths possibly peaking in the second or third week of February. But I expect that both the Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization will declare the coronavirus outbreak to be under control by early April.",
            "Under this baseline scenario, my best estimate is that the virus will have only a limited negative economic impact. Its effect on Chinese GDP growth rate in 2020 is likely to be small, perhaps a decline on the order of 0.1 percentage point. The effect in the first quarter of 2020 will be big, perhaps lowering growth by one percentage point on an annualized basis, but this will be substantially offset by above-trend growth during the rest of the year. The impact on world GDP growth will be even smaller.",
            "Such a prediction recalls the experience of the 2003 SARS crisis: a big decline in China's GDP growth in the second quarter of that year was then largely offset by higher growth in the subsequent two quarters. While the full-year growth rate in 2003 was about 10 percent, many investment banks' economists over-predicted the epidemic's negative impact on growth. Looking at annual real GDP growth rates from 2000 to 2006, it is very hard to see a SARS effect in the data.",
            "Some fear that the timing of the oubreak  at the start of the week-long Chinese New Year celebration, and in the middle of traditional school-break travels  will exacerbate the economic fallout by keeping many people away from shops, restaurants, and travel hubs. But three important factors may limit the virus' impact.",
            "First, in contrast to the SARS outbreak, China is now in the internet commerce age, with consumers increasingly doing their shopping online. Much of the reduction in offline sales owing to the virus will likely be offset by an increase in online purchases. And most of the vacations canceled today will probably be replaced by future trips, because better-off households have already set aside a holiday travel budget.",
            "Many factories have scheduled production stoppages during the Chinese New Year holidays anyway, so the timing of the outbreak may minimize the need for further shutdowns. Similarly, many government offices and schools had planned holiday closures independently of the virus outbreak.",
            "The government has just announced an extension of the holiday period, but many companies will find ways to make up the lost time later in the year. The short-term negative impact is thus likely to be concentrated among restaurants, hotels, and airlines.",
            "Second, all reports indicate that the Wuhan coronavirus is less deadly than SARS (although it may have a faster rate of transmission initially). Equally important, the Chinese authorities have been much swifter than they were during the SARS episode in moving from controlling information to controlling the spread of the virus.",
            "By implementing aggressive measures to isolate actual and potential patients from the rest of the population, the authorities have improved their chances of containing the outbreak much sooner. That, in turn, increases the likelihood that the lost economic output this quarter will be offset by increased activity in the remainder of the year.",
            "Third, whether or not China's trade negotiators realized the severity of the Wuhan virus when they signed the phase one trade deal with the United States on January 15, the timing of the agreement has turned out to be fortunate. By greatly increasing its imports of masks and medical supplies from the U.S. (and elsewhere), China can simultaneously tackle the health crisis and fulfill its promise under the deal to import more goods.",
            "The virus' impact on other economies will be even more limited. During the last half-decade, many major central banks have developed models to gauge the impact of a slowdown in China on their economies. These models were not built with the current health crisis in mind, but they do take into account trade and financial linkages between China and their respective economies.",
            "As a rule of thumb, the negative impact of a decrease in China's GDP growth on the U.S. and European economies is about one-fifth as large in percentage terms. For example, if the current coronavirus outbreak lowers China's growth rate by 0.1 percentage point, then growth in the U.S. and Europe is likely to slow by about 0.02 percentage point.",
            "The impact on Australia's economy may be twice as large, given its stronger commodity-trade and tourism links with China, but a 0.04-percentage-point reduction in growth is still small.",
            "Such calculations assume that the coronavirus does not spread widely to these countries and cause direct havoc. This currently seems unlikely, given the low number of cases outside China.",
            "Of course, the impact on China and other economies could be more severe if the coronavirus crisis were to last much longer than this baseline scenario assumes. In that case, it is important to remember that Chinese policymakers still have room for both monetary and fiscal expansion: the banking-sector reserve ratio is relatively high, and the share of public-sector debt to GDP is still manageable compared to China's international peers. By using this policy space when necessary, China's authorities could limit the ultimate impact of the current health crisis.",
            "The coronavirus outbreak is understandably causing alarm in China and elsewhere. But from an economic perspective, it is too early to panic.",

If you see a feverish Chinese, or such person from any other races, politely ask them to go to the hospital.",

            "Going back 17 years to 2003, the SARS epidemic mysteriously subsided by summer after ravaging for more than half a year, starting in winter. Many are hoping that the novel coronavirus, which also surged in winter, could naturally disappear as the weather gets warmer.",
            "However, people's guards cannot be let down as experts pointed out that no evidence suggests the novel coronavirus will disappear in summer.",
            "Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a call interview on February 12 that this assumption was premature. \"We haven't been through even a single year with this pathogen.\"",
            "\"It is a false hope to say, 'Yes it will just disappear in summertime, like influenza virus,'\" Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said on Friday. He echoed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus' briefing on March 3 that the virus is not SARS, MERS or influenza, but \"a unique virus with unique characteristics.\"",
            "\"There is no evidence right now to suggest that that will happen,\" said Ryan, adding that the activity or behavior of the virus in different climatic conditions remains unclear.",
            "Ryan stressed that countries should \"assume the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread\" and make every effort to fight against the epidemic.",

            "A week ago, it looked as though the COVID-19 could be brought under control. Now, for the first time, I'm concerned about the potential for the outbreak of the coronavirus to become a global pandemic. Many Western media speculations about the potential for tens of millions of deaths worldwide is still overblown, but we are entering a critical phase in the fight against the virus.",
            "Within China, attempts to contain the virus seem to be working: whilst the situation within Hubei Province remains serious, cases outside Hubei are largely on the decline. I've been critical of the Western media in recent months for being too Western-centric, for failing to understand how other cultures and countries operate.",
            "Oddly, then, it seems that when it comes to the coronavirus, we've become far too focused upon China alone.",
            "Back in January, Icommentedthat the biggest global threat would be if the coronavirus were to take hold in a country with a less robust healthcare system. A secondary threat is if those who have the virus are not immediately open and honest about it, which causes delays in identifying new cases and people who might be at risk.",
            "To the Western media, \"news\" must be \"new\"  and until very recently, those concerns were hypothetical, without a human face. It's difficult to report on something which is precisely the same as it was last week, however important it is.",
            "The biggest risk factors for the COVID-19 aren't also big news, because they remain the same from one day to the next  until the number of cases starts to spike. The media, therefore, did not report on the biggest genuine threats: until there are actual cases which fit that pattern, it doesn't provide the basis for the kind of story they wish to report.",
            "Now, as the virus has gone elsewhere, the media begins to catch up.",
            "From an international perspective, there are three locations which are particularly worrying. In Iran, at the time of writing, 12 people have died out of 47 cases. Elsewhere in the world, the death rate is in the order of two percent, and even then, the figures tend to appear lower because cases are reported before it is known whether or not a patient will recover.",
            "When Iran is reporting a death rate that is already almost at 20 percent, by far the most likely explanation is that Iran has failed to diagnose many more cases of the virus. For Iran to have such a high proportion of deaths compared with the rest of the world is, statistically, so unlikely as to set all kinds of alarm bells ringing.",
            "Without diagnosis, it's incredibly difficult to trace contacts and prevent future cases. If Iran has indeed failed to identify other less serious cases which did not require hospitalization, then the virus will continue to spread in ways which will defy the ability to trace it.",
            "Their decision to close schools and religious and cultural centers across 14 provinces suggests they are aware they have an issue with cases going unreported: nowhere else has seen such a blanket approach with so few cases.",
            "In South Korea, the virus has spread through theShincheonji religious sect. This proved difficult to trace, becoming evident only through the use of GPS tracking. Furthermore, those in South Korea who have defied the ban on public protests risk spreading the virus further.",
            "There is always a danger of misinformation, particularly where a government is not trusted by a significant minority of the people, leading to the failure of control measures. Politically, it would be much harder for the South Korean government to mirror China's actions in quarantining an entire city or province.",
            "In Italy, a sudden rise in cases to more than 200 suggests that they have failed to find their so-called \"Patient Zero\"  the first person infected. Whilst it's still likely that they will be able to bring it under control, having placed 10 towns in the Lombardy region on lockdown, the rate of progress is a clear concern.",
            "Beyond these areas, there is the potential that other countries with weaker healthcare systems might be in the same situation as Iran  but we don't yet know it. Even supposing that the outbreaks in Iran and South Korea can be brought completely under control, there is still the potential for under-reporting elsewhere in the world.",
            "In a recent press conference,WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, \"We are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case. The window of opportunity is still there. But our window of opportunity is narrowing.\"",

            "Offended but understanding",
            "As news of a South Korean petition against Chinese visitors to the country and Asian-looking students in the UK being pelted with eggs reached China, alongside a flurry of racially insensitive foreign media coverage and signs on restaurants overseas barring Chinese customers, such incidences of \"Sinophobic\" sentiment in recent weeks have been \"no surprise\" to Lizzie, a 25-year-old former English teacher from central China's Hubei Province, currently living in Beijing.",
            "Having studied in the UK and traveled abroad, she did not find the racist bent of one faction of the global response to China's coronavirus epidemic to be new. But it was still offensive.",
            "\"Everyone around the world may get this illness, not just (the) Chinese,\" Lizzie said. \"It's rude and cruel to blame someone during this time.\"",
            "Sympathy for Chinese people in the midst of a health crisis, and the perception that anti-China racism rubs salt in this wound, was shared among other Chinese millennials CGTN spoke to. Sinophobic behavior is \"not news,\" said Annie (name changed), 26, an events manager from Beijing still based there. \"But I was surprised it (has become) stronger nowadays when many Chinese people are suffering from this virus, she added.",
            "Nonetheless, some young Chinese were able to brush off their angry and hurt feelings. \"Cliched prejudgements exist everywhere,\" said Jiehua, 31, who works for an art gallery in Beijing but is originally from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. She attributed offensive behavior to a lack of education and suggested that those abroad perpetuating this may have \"never traveled.\"",
            "\"It is normal that people are scared of death. If one tries to attack any Chinese individuals physically or mentally, maybe he/she is just acting out of fear. We cannot force anyone to accept the disease but no one should hurt any others for their sickness,\" Annie said. \"Now people are also panicking due to the virus, not major racism,\" Jiehua agreed.",
            "What sentiments have been gaining traction?",
            "An article first posted on LinkedIn in early February by Italian-American author and entrepreneur Mario Cavolo, who is based in northeastern China's Liaoning Province, has been widely shared among Chinese netizens and since republished by some Chinese media platforms. \"Something's Not Right Here Folks | A Look at USA 2009 H1N1 Virus Compared to China 2020 Corona Virus\" has struck a chord with the Chinese audience, with some posting on Weibo that foreigners were transferring anti-China animosity onto coronavirus paranoia.",
            "One well-meaning, if clumsy, attempt to establish a panacea also raised eyebrows on Weibo. Mayor of Florence Dario Nardella initiated a \"hug a Chinese\" movement on February 1 via Twitter, when the Italian government had announced the suspension of all flights between China and Italy a day earlier. Nardella's initiative was ridiculed on Weibo by some Chinese netizens, with one user saying that people should \"just act normal.\"",
            "Race is brought into the international discussion on China whenever it is convenient, according to one academic. When researching how the \"Rise of China\" was perceived in racialized terms in Western countries, and focusing on Germany as a case study, \"We found that the historical 'Yellow Peril' perception of colonial and imperial times was still surprisingly present, for examples in depictions of (the) Chinese as a faceless, threatening, dangerous mass,\" said Daniel Marwecki, senior teaching fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. \"We argue that there is a kind of racist repertoire that can be drawn from whenever the 'need' arises  such as now,\" he added.",
            "Empathetic towards China's internal divisions",
            "Some Chinese people's survival instincts during the novel coronavirus outbreak has exposed divisions within domestic society, as pointed out by some of the young people CGTN spoke to.",
            "\"We cannot blame foreigners because we are slightly biased ourselves, against each other,\" said Robert, a 30-year-old lawyer from Shanxi Province living in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province, referring to recent incidences of Chinese people not welcoming those from Wuhan, the city at the center of the coronavirus epidemic.",
            "Similarly, Jiehua described division within China as \"worse than racism.\"",
            "But, Robert was also hopeful. \"People will go back to their normal lives... and their biased opinions will fade away,\" he reasoned.",
            "Stories have been circulating about locals in Chinese cities such as Shanghai feeling less than thrilled about the masses of migrant workers returning after the Spring Festival holiday, during which time most people typically journey back to their home towns to spend time with family. Fears about coronavirus contagion have been exacerbated as much of China has been on the move as a result of the travel rush that marks the festive season's end.",
            "But, Annie explained that such protective, territorial feelings recur every year because \"most people just don't want share their own living supplies and resources, also they don't want compete with others for the same job position.\"",
            "Chinese people's relatively recent international awareness, thanks to study and travel abroad as well as the rise in popularity of foreign television shows and other popular culture, has meant that their exposure to the nuances of \"Sinophobic\" racism is fairly new. \"We don't really know or understand racism in China,\" said Hope, in her late twenties and from northwest China's Gansu Province, who works organizing programs for foreigners to learn Chinese in Beijing. \"In China, the divide is more between rich and poor people.\"",
            "But while these millennials acknowledge the inequality at home, China has set a target of alleviating all domestic poverty this year. Also, despite the tales of division, there has been a strong show of Chinese unity with donations of cash and resources flowing into Wuhan and other virus-hit cities in central China's Hubei Province more broadly.",
            "All those CGTN spoke to had all studied or traveled abroad, or both, and spoke English. Some had non-Chinese partners. They recognized that the anti-China racism that has spiked of late was not true of the majority of foreigners.",
            "\"I think people who are racist will always find ways to humiliate people they don't like, the virus just gives them more excuses,\" said Hope. \"I'm not very sensitive, more because I always meet people who really like China and Chinese culture. So I know that most people are not like that,\" she added.",

            "This is the second episode of our series \"Faces Fighting Coronavirus\" chronicling people from different walks of life who are affected by the outbreak as well as those who are trying to keep their lives as normal as they can to keep our society running. You can find the first story here.",
            "Our second episode documents how to treat every life fairly and equally in this difficult time.",
            "Fang Junwen had given up on her plan to go home for China's most important holiday, where she would have reunited with her parents in the northeastern city of Shenyang.",
            "As a pet hotel manager, she flip-flopped two days before the Spring Festival began, when a handful of her customers said they would not be able to pick up their pets as scheduled due to the coronavirus outbreak and corresponding preventive measures.",
            "This is a harsh winter for Fang, who has been working in the pet industry for over a decade. Her four staff members had left for the week-long family reunion holiday but were unexpectedly stuck at home given traffic restrictions, leaving her to tend to the dogs and cats alone.",
            "To set her customers at ease, she's been living in the store since late January so that she could check the status of their furry friends and send them videos at any time of the day.",
            "Each day, the pet store would send one physical exam report, two videos and six pictures of each pet to its owner online, but the abrupt outbreak disrupted this routine  Fang now sends two physical check forms, a dozen videos, plus numerous photos to each pet owner every day.",
            "\"Yuan, the owner of the twin cats  two-and-half-year-old Dingding and Dangdang, had returned to her hometown in Wuhan on January 21 and originally planned to fetch them on February 1. But now she's not sure how much longer the cats will stay here,\" Fang said. The owner had expected to be away for 10 days, but her leave was extended indefinitely as the ground zero city has been on a lockdown since January 23.",
            "At first, Yuan had called several times a day to see if Dingding and Dangdang had stress responses as a result of their extended stay in an unfamiliar environment. \"Cats would show reactions such as hiding, vomiting and poor appetite when they feel they are dumped by their owners,\" noted Fang. \"The only way to relieve their stress is to let them communicate with their owners more and appease them to make them feel at home. Yuan is at ease knowing the cats are with us.\"",
            "Other cats in the store aren't as lucky. There's the fretful Paomian, which means \"instant noodles.\" \"I can't reach her owner. I discovered I was blacklisted [by the owner] days ago,\" Fang said.",
            "During every Spring Festival holiday  usually the busiest season of a year for pet boarding, some pets are abandoned, according to Gao Maoxiang, founder and CEO of Menta Pets. \"But there are more such cases so far this year,\" he noted.",
            "The higher abandonment rate may have derived from a slew of rumors that mammals carry and spread the novel coronavirus. The fear was further fueled when prestigious epidemiologist Li Lanjuan said, \"This virus is transmitted between mammals, so we should take precautions with them.\"",
            "Public panic has failed to subside even after the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that there is no evidence to show that companion animals or pets such as dogs and cats can be infected with the novel coronavirus.",
            "Over the past days, pet cats and dogs could be seen cast out on the streets or stranded somewhere alone. In a Shanghai neighborhood, five cats were reported to have been hurled out of the window. In the Jiangsu city of Wuxi, a community committee staff member allegedly buried a cat alive when disinfecting the condo of its owner, who was diagnosed with the coronavirus infection and quarantined.",
            "\"I feel grieved and powerless. Every life should be treated equally. People can have a look into the cases of pet hospitals and will find out that so far there's no single case of the coronavirus originating from or being transmitted by pet cats and dogs,\" Fang said.",
            "\"Instead, in the time of the coronavirus, pets are more important than ever before. Their companion can relieve your anxiety caused by the barrage of information overload that you find increasingly hard to distinguish,\" Gao told CGTN.",
            "For Fang, it's more about taking care of the pets with little time to rest and relying on bread or instant noodles until the lockdown is lifted and people return to normal lives. But for Gao, who now owns 20 pet stores across the country, the coronavirus outbreak is also bringing a chill to his business.",
            "Besides the cases of pets being abandoned, the majority of the pets need to stay longer because their owners are embayed in gravely infected cities like Wuhan, Wenzhou and Hangzhou, or live in sealed-off neighborhoods in Beijing. \"There's a staff shortage to care for these little fluffy friends. Some of my employees have not returned yet while others are undergoing a 14-day self-quarantine after they come back,\" Gao said.",
            "He has suspended all in-store pet wash and grooming services to save labor as well as maintain a hygienic environment for on board pets. An increasing number of online orders for pet food and sanitary products could only offset the revenue loss from a sharp decline in in-store shopping. He also chose to shut down a store in a quarantined community in southern Beijing and transferred the pets there to nearby stores.",
            "But he's optimistic. \"After the outbreak, there will probably be a greater demand for pets and hence related products. Their companion will help tide you over cold, lonely times like this.\"",

            "The National Health Commission (NHC) Saturday reiterated that the major transmission routes of the new coronavirus are still respiratory droplets and contact, and other routes such as aerosol transmission and fecal-oral transmission remain to be confirmed. The statement, published in the \"Question and Answer\" section of the NHC's website, came amid speculation about the possible transmission of the deadly coronavirus through aerosols, or smaller particles that can travel a longer distance than droplets from a patient's sneezing or coughing. Aerosol transmission refers to when the respiratory droplets lose water in the air, and the leftover proteins and pathogens form nuclei or dust floats far away in the form of aerosols, causing long-distance transmissions, the NHC said, citing Feng Luzhao, a researcher at the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\"There is no proof of novel coronavirus transmission through aerosols so far,\" it added. \"Epidemiological investigations have shown that most of the confirmed cases used to have close contact with infected patients,\" the commission said. The conclusion is written in the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment program of the coronavirus published by the NHC on Sunday morning.",
            "Aerosol transmission can only occur under certain special conditions, such as when performing medical procedures, according to Feng. Asked whether the novel coronavirus is in the air, the commission said that as the virus mainly transmits through droplets, which can't spread long, there is generally no novel coronavirus in the air at places with normal ventilation. Therefore, residents are recommended to open the windows at least twice a day, which is an effective measure to reduce the risk of infection, it said. The World Health Organization (WHO) was also asked about whether the novel coronavirus could be transmitted through aerosols. In its response on Saturday, WHO did not confirm, but said the evidence shows that the virus is transmitted by droplets, which are heavier and hard to float in the air.However, this is a new virus, WHO said, adding it will continue to monitor any possible means of transmission.Online posts about possible transmission routes through aerosols have been circulating in social media recently as the new virus killed hundreds of people in China and infected more than 30,000 people. The fear was reignited on Saturday when Zeng Qun, deputy head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said at a press conference that aerosol transmission was confirmed."

            "Since 2003 the world has faced three outbreaks caused by the coronavirus family. But a vaccine was absent during the outbreak of SARS, and MERS, and very likely, this time too. But it's not all bad news. What many people don't realize, is that over past 17 years, the time it takes to develop a vaccine has drastically shortened.",
            "Vaccines usually carry inactive disease-causing proteins made by virus. These work by mimicking how a virus infects your body. They stimulate the body's immune response and create antibodies. This primes the body to respond more rapidly and effectively if exposed to the infectious agent in the future.",
            "In the case of the coronavirus, these proteins are those spikes, which look like crowns. The spike protein works as door opener, allowing the virus to get inside and infect a cell.",
            "A vaccine for the coronavirus would copy what these spikes protein do to prompt the immune system. But it does so in a safer way.",
            "Viruses that are inactive or make weaker can work as vaccines. Firstly, scientists isolate and acquire the actual coronavirus. This step has been done by scientists already. The virus is then cultivated in a lab using chicken eggs or other mammalian cells. Then, it's developed it into a less-threatening version",
            "In recent years, a new method has emerged called RNA vaccine. It takes advantage of the way cells make proteins. A cell will use its genetic material, the DNA, as the template to make messenger RNA. This RNA will give out orders to build proteins in the cell.",
            "So an RNA vaccine consists of a messenger RNA strand coded for a virus protein instead of a normal protein. Once it is delivered into the body, cells use this genetic information to produce foreign protein, causing an immune reaction.",
            "A major advantage of the RNA vaccine is that as soon as we know the entire genetic code of coronavirus, which we did in the beginning of January, RNA can be produced in a lab using readily available materials. It's less expensive and way faster than conventional methods. In fact, a team from China just announced that they have started to test their RNA vaccine on rats, less than 2 months since the start of the outbreak. Not only this, but RNA does not integrate itself into the host genome, and is degraded once the protein is made. So, theoretically it's safer.",
            "Of course, it's not perfect, it may cause an unintended immune reaction. Delivery is another challenge because free RNAs in the body are quickly broken down. The vaccine would be frozen during transport as well as storage... And no matter how rapid the timeline is for vaccine development, animal testing and clinical trials are still \"rate-limiting\" steps. And even if time can be squeezed, mass producing vaccines quickly is another huge challenge.",
            "Though shots weren't ready in time in the last 17 years, research on SARS and MERS vaccines has allowed scientists to be better prepared than ever. Some experts believe that because different types of coronaviruses can share similarities, a universal vaccine could theoretically be developed. Given we've been hit three times in the past two decades, we can only hope for such a result."

            "Like any other unexpected outbreak, coronavirus caused fear, anxiety and panic among people in Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei Province in general and entire world. The good news is that China's response on how to combat and stop the spread of the coronavirus has been undoubtedly swift, and amazing as World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted: \"I will praise China again and again because its actions actually helped in reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus to other countries.\"",
            "While there is need for countries to act swiftly in ensuring the coronavirus does not spread more, there is need to understand that infectious outbreaks and their agents never mind about our political ideologies or even borders  that we can all at one time be victims of such outbreak and hence, the need for combined efforts despite our different political ideologies, after all, what threatens our well-being is common.",
            "Therefore, a threat to people's well-being like coronavirus which can spread and affect many people in a short time should encourage us to work together in such times and find solutions other than closing our borders and thinking of evacuating our citizens fast like in a spirit of every man for himself and God for us all. Unilateral actions like travel restrictions against Chinese citizens by some countries even after WHO advised against such should be avoided since such measures can affect economies, information sharing and samples of microbes or viruses which is a key step in finding how to counter a new outbreak.",
            "Unless there is good cooperation and a gesture of good will to working together in such times, we risk a repeat of 2007 when Indonesia stopped sharing samples with foreign researchers during the outbreak of H5N1 bird flu, fearing sharing their samples would be used to develop vaccines which would in-turn be very expensive for them.",
            "Travel restrictions and blame game do not only violate WHO laws but also affect efforts to quickly fight spreading of such virus on top of economic consequences as a result of such travel restrictions.",
            "Also, media especially the Western media reporting on outbreaks particularly coronavirus has focused more on causing fear other than mobilizing and urging international community to stand as one and ensure greater success is achieved in containing the virus or even highlighting more the positive sides already realized in the efforts to contain the coronavirus.",
            "For example, while some Western media outlets are covered with screaming headlines of coronavirus in China whose death toll is about 304 with more than 14,411 infections as of February 2, few media outlets have made headlines about Center for Diseases Control and Prevention's report on January 31 that currently, 10,000 people have died and 180,000 people have been hospitalized because of flu in the U.S.",
            "Therefore, as people, no matter our political ideologies or even geographical borders, we face the same challenge when it comes to virus-related illnesses and other pandemics. Unless different governments and organizations work hand in hand, we risk seeing outbreaks that would otherwise be contained becoming epidemics and later pandemics. Therefore, it is in the interest of the world to see the coronavirus getting quickly contained to avoid further human and possible economic losses. And anything that hurts China, the second largest economy in the international community, like the coronavirus, hurts the world.",

In Iran, the death toll has climbed to at least 19, with its deputy health minister tested positive for the virus. South Korea announced an additional 334 cases on February 25, bringing the total number of the infected up to 1,595, making it the largest outbreak outside of China. Nearly 900 cases have been reported in Japan. The United States is seeing its first instance of potential community transmission. And on February 26, the World Health Organization (WHO) said \"the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.\"",
            "WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had made warnings to the world that each country needs to prepare for a domestic outbreak. However, as the number soars, national governments appear to be scrambling for responses.",
            "\"The problem is that the source of the disease is still unknown,\" Prof. John Cai, director of CEIBS Centre for Health Care Management and Policy, commented on the worldwide spread, \"with no sources identified and no viable vaccine, quarantine appears to be the most effective way to combat the virus.\"",
            "But governance has a decisive effect on a quarantine's effectiveness. \"Once an outbreak occurs, a centralized response is needed, and few countries can match China's ability to mobilize the government and the society,\" observed the professor, who pointed out that throughout China's cultural history, collectivism is emphasized. This gives people a sense of collective responsibility in face of crisis, enabling the government to call on the society as a whole to respond to the crisis. Citizen's self-quarantining at home is an example of the responsibility taken up by the society. The WHO's press conference on February 24 praised China's \"all-of-society\" and \"all-of-government\" response to the virus.",
            "In other countries, like European nations and the U.S., individualism often take precedence. This makes it harder for government to enlist the entire society in a centralized way to prevent the spread of the disease.",
            "\"Also, the relationship between the 'CDCs' and their respective governments is crucial in a public health crisis,\" Cai said. The departments responsible for disease control and prevention can focus exclusively on the medical and health side of the issue. The ruling administrations, however, have to do a balancing act. They need to find a balance between the necessity for taking drastic public health actions and the economy, politics, and diplomacy.",
            "This could partially explain the contradictory rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration on this disease. From different standpoints, the agency and the administration could reach different conclusions on the COVID-19. While the CDC is alerted, the officials inside the White House might not have reached the similar awareness level as the health experts, thus making the U.S. CDC's suggestions at odds with the administration's statements.",
            "CDC's authority, Cai believes, is essential in governments' responses to COVID-19. The agency's power in time of public health crisis must be clarified in more details given their expertise on the subject. Similar deficiency exists in China too. Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a well-known Chinese respiratory expert, also asserted that the Chinese CDC doesn't have enough authority to make decision. Continuous research and accumulation are critical in deterring and combating infectious diseases, and CDC's role has to be elevated.",
            "\"China's system gives it an advantage in managing the outbreak,\" Prof. Cai said. And the world should take notice of it. However, given the difference in governance, learning from China might not be a small feat.",

From SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) to COVID-19, all emerging epidemics seem to be lung diseases. Why is that?Dr. Zhi said that the lung is an open organ that connects the body with the atmosphere, and it plays a crucial role in the metabolism of the body. Therefore, when a new respiratory virus emerges, the lung is most likely to encounter the virus and suffers damage.The analysis of confirmed cases has shown that people with underlying diseases, especially lung diseases, are at a higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19.

            "\"In late April 2003, schools and universities in Beijing were all closed. Many units reduced their activities on emergency services. People who could work from home or via telephone and internet stayed at home. Restaurants and all entertainment places closed the doors, also many shops were closed, in exactly the same way as we are seeing today due to the coronavirus outbreak,\" Uwe Kraeuter told CGTN Digital, recalling the near-identical prevention and control measures enforced in the Chinese capital during the previous epidemic.",
            "\"Swimming in the lakes around the city was prohibited as it was feared that it could lead to the spread of the virus. All conferences and other events were all cancelled. No tourists, no business partners were coming anymore from abroad. The hotels were all empty. People were asked to avoid travelling other parts of the country,\" added the German filmmaker and author who has lived in China since 1974.",
            "Confined to spending most of their time at home for nearly two months during the SARS outbreak, Kraeuter said that it was humor and hope that kept most people going. \"We were even joking about the epidemic to make light of a serious situation. For instance, a Chinese friend sent me this message: It has been announced that from today, all wives and mothers and children must be kept at home while the men are allowed to go outside and enjoy SARS, meaning Songs, Alcohol, Romance, Sex,\" he said, bursting into a hearty laughter.",
            "Some of the jokes during SARS could very well be relevant for situation in Beijing today, he noted, remembering another one: \"How do you recognize a Beijinger? The answer is: They are becoming fat from eating too much and sitting at home. Their skin is getting white because they don't go out. Their hands are becoming delicate because of constant cleaning. Their vision is getting blurred due to watching television all the time.\"",
            "Comparing the social life in Beijing during the two epidemics, Kraeuter noted how WeChat has made the biggest difference this time around. Besides sharing humorous content with friends and staying connected with family, the Chinese multi-purpose app has contributed hugely in making everyone informed about the ground situation.",
            "\"At that time [during SARS], we only had telephones and e-mail. You cannot compare e-mail to WeChat. With WeChat, people feel empowered and involved, taking part in various activities despite being at home. Besides our daily lives, WeChat could be used to provide help to others in any part of China. I am very thankful to WeChat that has enabled us as a society to go through many difficult times,\" he said.",

            "He also said that it was during the SARS outbreak that he saw for the first time nearly everyone wearing a mask. However, people were still able to find time to meet friends for an occasional party. This is in contrast to the current scenario where people have been discouraged to meet and eat in groups. \"In these last over two weeks, none of my friends have had meetings outside. During SARS, we had mask and so on but still we had some parties,\" he remarked.",
            "Kraeuter felt that preventive measures during SARS led to an entire generation of Chinese people being more aware and therefore better prepared for such outbreaks, including the current one. \"I think that all those children who at the time were 10 or 14 years old and now young adults, they had already experienced a similar thing. So this time, during the coronavirus outbreak there was no shock as it was the last time in our Beijing life.\"",
            "The German expat was all praise for the remarkable discipline Chinese people have exhibited during both the epidemics and gave credit to China's rich cultural and civilizational heritage for such a measured public response. \"China has been one of the most culturally developed countries for hundreds of years. So, with this background, I'm not astonished about the behavior of the Chinese people and the way they are getting through in spite of all the difficulties. I am confident that China will be able to handle the situation.\"",

            "\"Of course, there is a bias against China. The political intentions of certain leaders aren't reasonable. We have already noticed a hateful campaign against migrants in the U.S. and several European countries. Many people, blinded by their political ideology, seem to be using the coronavirus situation to trigger hatred against Chinese people, which is essentially racism on display,\" he said.",
            "Exposing the overreaction to coronavirus in the west, Kraeuter, a westerner himself, pointed out how seasonal flu continues to be the biggest threat in Europe and the U.S. \"Let me say here that, 650,000 people die in the world from seasonal flu each year. Every year, about 80,000 Americans who can die of flu in one winter alone. Germany is a very small country, so the numbers are smaller, but still over 25,000 German patients die annually due to seasonal flu.\"",

Avoiding large gatherings of people, practicing social distancing, washing our hands often and self-isolating in case of suspected infection are measures we can all put into practice to help contain the spread of the virus and minimize the damage this is causing to our societies.",

On Monday, when Beijing reported zero new COVID-19 cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said almost nine times more cases had been reported outside China than inside the country in the last 24 hours.",

            "\"As the days go by, both human movements and coal consumption to power 'the world's factory' are on a gradual increase,\" Moreira, who has lived in China since 2013, told CGTN Digital in a Skype interview.",
            "\"From an economic standpoint, the best way to illustrate China's gradual recovery is by looking at certain indicators. Nomura Global Economics released data which assesses multiple indicators and how they have been changing daily  from the amount of people returning to work, to railway trips, city metro trips and coal consumption,\" he said.",
            "\"Even though in comparison to the same period of last year the percentage is quite low, you can see a steady increase at each passing day, which sends out a positive signal that the economy is picking up,\" added Moreira, a business development manager who has worked with Chinese state-owned enterprises and multinational corporations.",
            "Moreira also noted that a realistic pointer of social revival and market recovery on the ground would be the day schools across China are reopened. \"There are many variables at play here and my answer will be no better than guesswork. A good indicator perhaps, one that has been cited by foreign fund managers as their sign for market recovery, is the date children will go back to school, as their safety is paramount.\"",
            "Government intervention, postponed consumption and a V-shaped recovery",
            "Here's how coronavirus battle is paving the way for a much stronger China 2.0",
            "A key factor in speeding up this economic recovery is the timely intervention of the Chinese government, which according to Moreira, are in three crucial areas.",
            "\"One is the fiscal and the financial stimulus, especially for the affected businesses during the outbreak. Another one is the way that they are looking for safe means to deploy the migrant workforce, getting people to get back to work, get back on to production. And the third one would be how they are deploying technology to support and educate businesses on how they can deal with the crisis and be more efficient,\" he elaborated.",
            "\"All of these will play, and have played so far, a decisive role in how this recovery is taking place,\" he added.",
            "Moreira suggested there's an underlying assumption of a \"postponed consumption\" behind the government measures. \"There has been obviously a period of quarantine and a halt in economic activity, but this only means that the consumption has been delayed. And they believe that as time goes by, this postponed consumption, the investment activities and as the factories restart production, all of this will create a sort of compensation and help support the economic recovery,\" he explained.",
            "\"The most likely scenario is a V-shaped curve  a decline in economic activities followed by a rapid recovery that will compensate and annul the economic toll that has been felt,\" Moreiraadded citing last week's forecast by JPMorgan Chase which projected China's Q2 growth to bounce back at 15 percent after a negative 4-percent growth in Q1. \"This is aligned with what the government is foreseeing.\"",
            "'Contactless society' waits to 'unplug'",
            "The COVID-19 outbreak has compelled people in China to re-calibrate and, in many cases, suspend their social lives and work. Moreira described this as an interesting shift towards a \"contactless society\".",
            "\"Obviously, this is a temporary phase because of the imposed quarantine, because people are staying at home, because businesses are still getting back on track. But I think the bottom line is that life in China, and we can feel it also by living here, has been sort of 'uploaded'. China's life has moved online,\" he observed.",
            "\"You see lots of examples that illustrate this brilliantly. Obviously as people are going online, they are spending more time online, they are using platforms like Douyin (the Chinese equivalent of TikTok)  the short video app. A host who started broadcasting himself sleeping made 37,000 yuan overnight!\" he added.",
            "Moreira counted several other social trends that have picked up during this period such as cloud clubbing (as clubs cannot open, they live stream DJ performances); cloud drinking (friends do video conference to drink together); online fitness classes (as gyms remain closed); reality TV featuring the quarantine day-to-day life of celebrities; courts conducting trials online; remote work platforms; broadcasting classes for students; and even celebrating Valentine's Day from a distance.",
            "\"I think as things slowly start to return back to normal, people are going to start 'unplugging'. This trend of increased online time is going to change. But there's no denial that businesses and government and individuals have learnt that digital technology in China plays a huge role at the heart of society, at the heart of businesses and at the heart of being able to use it to cope with the crisis as well,\" he noted.",

            "Emphasizing that the way China has responded to the crisis reflects the great capacity of its society to adapt, Moreira predicted the recovery, when it happens, will lead to a \"new sense of normality\".",
            "\"The new sense of normality is the crossroad of everything we have been discussing so far. It's the learning how to deal with all the losses  both human life and financial. It's this rise of the 'contactless society' where everything happens at a distance, even if it is only temporary. And also, this possibility to 'upload' your life online in these times of isolation and crisis. And also, obviously from the government's side, the improvement on how they respond to emergencies in times of crisis,\" he elucidated.",
            "Moreira believed that at the underlying trait of this new \"normal\" is a more deep-layered and emotional feeling of unity and solidarity that all Chinese people and even the country's large expat population have developed for each other.",
            "\"As we return to our normal lives, none of us will ever forget the herculean efforts and sacrifices of so many, especially people in the front lines like the healthcare workers, and all the economic efforts that it took to ensure that we could be kept safe,\" he remarked.",
            "Moreira recalled a curious hashtag he saw on Chinese social media recently to summarize this emotion. \"In Chinese they are saying  (Mei you yi ge chun tian bu hui dao lai), which translates something like 'There is no spring that won't come'. And this is the feeling that people have that it's been a major toll. Winter was here, and it was a harsh winter, but it will also be over and spring will come.\"",

            "\"The risk of re-importing the virus, the chances of a new outbreak, all of them pose a potential risk of jeopardizing the immense human effort so far but China will find its own way to recovery even if other countries face hard times ahead,\" the Portuguese expat said citing a McKinsey report from June 2019 the shows that while the world's exposure to China is on the rise, China's global exposure is falling.",

            "An expert group of the NHC has conducted an analysis of over 500 recovered patients, which showed that the average hospital stay for them was ten days, Guo said.",
            "And some who were severely ill were also cured, she added.",
            "The sample analysis shows six percent of the recovered were severely sick, which is very encouraging, suggesting even those in critical condition can recover after proper treatment, said Wang Guiqiang, director of Infectious Diseases Department at Peking University First Hospital.",
            "The analysis also revealed that antiviral therapy and traditional Chinese medicine are effective in treatment, said Guo.",
            "Such experience will be summarized and included in the NHC's diagnosis and treatment program to guide clinical work, which will greatly improve the curing rate, she added.",

            "Questions from netizens",
            "Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, also addressed several questions of the public's common concerns at the press conference.",
            "Q: Do I have to wear gloves when going outside?",
            "A: Wearing gloves is no substitute for washing hands. Cotton, cloth gloves can both help to reduce hand pollution. There's no need to wear medical latex gloves. But remember to wash your hands whether you wear gloves or not, to reduce the spread of hand contamination.",
            "Q: The masks should be taken off when passing security checks at train stations and airports, will I be infected?",
            "A: The face recognition during security checks requires the removal of a mask for a short period of time, which generally does not cause virus transmission. Keep a certain distance from others during the process and put on the mask right after the security check.",
            "Q: There have been reports of infections in 50 or even 15 seconds without wearing a mask. What should I do?",
            "A: The key to infection depends on how close you are to the patient and whether you take precautions. The spread of coronavirus is mainly by droplets, which can be created by breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing. So, if you, without any protective measures, are close to the patient who is talking, coughing, or sneezing, you're prone to be infected. Do remember to wear a mask when going to places where people gather.",
            "Q: Can I reuse my mask?",
            "A: There is no need to wear a mask: 1) if we are alone at home, or if the family members have never been outside; 2) if the community does not have an epidemic.",
            "For ordinary people, we just need ordinary masks, and it's not necessary to immediately throw them away after using them. I also wear a mask every day, and I change it once a day or two.",
            "It's not recommended to sterilize the mask with a microwave oven."

            "The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that preliminary results from clinical trials of therapeutics against COVID-19 are expected in three weeks.\"We're also looking forward to results from two clinical trials of therapeutics prioritized by the WHO R&D Blueprint,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a daily briefing.One of the trials he referred to is the combination of two drugs for HIV, Lopinavir and Ritonavir, while the other is testing an antiviral called remdesivir. \"We expect preliminary results in three weeks,\" he added.Remdesivir is a drug developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. It has shown good antiviral activity against SARS and MERS coronavirus in previous cell and animal experiments.It has also shown fairly good antiviral activity against the COVID-19 at the cellular level. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir started on February 6 in several hospitals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and the trial will last until the end of April.A study published in 2004 showed the anti-HIV drug combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir has \"substantial clinical benefit\" when given to patients who had SARS. The Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, where the first 41 known patients were treated, has already launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drug combination, according to a report by Chinese researchers in the Lancet medical journal late last month.The third version of COVID-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission suggested that taking two Lopinavir/Ritonavir pills and inhaling a dose of nebulized alpha-interferon twice a day could benefit patients.",

            "\"For confirmed parturients, breastfeeding is not recommended. Bottle-feeding is better,\" said Zhao Yangyu, senior obstetrician of Peking University Third Hospital, at a conference organized by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council. Existing data shows that the novel coronavirus nucleic acid was not detected in breast milk. But the number of such confirmed cases is quite small, which makes it hard to say anything for sure.However, there is a risk of infection by contact during breastfeeding. Therefore, bottle-feeding is advised. People have come up with the idea of extracting the milk first and then eliminating the virus by boiling the milk, since the virus is highly sensitive to high temperature, according to a study by a team from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.",
            "The study shows that temperature significantly affects COVID-19 transmission, but there has been no research on whether heating up mother's milk can kill the virus completely. At the same time, some nutrients in the milk will be lost after heating.So when can a woman diagnosed with COVID-19 start breastfeeding her baby? The answer: when she is cured after being discharged from the hospital, has been quarantined for over 14 days, and doesn't show any symptom of the disease upon return visit.",

            "COVID-19 means its crunch time for your business relationship with China and your Chinese colleagues. How you respond determines how your China business will grow after this crisis has passed. How you respond determines how welcome your business is in China and how effectively you can expand your networks.",
            "At a national level, some countries like Australia and Singapore have reacted by closing borders. Direct flights from China are stopped and Chinese passport holders are denied entry. These border closures are in direct contradiction to World Health Organization (WHO) advice. Australia, like some other Western countries, has been more nationally focussed on \"rescue\" missions to airlift their citizens from Wuhan. While these airlifts have also taken the opportunity to carry donated medical supplies, the limited flights are mainly about evacuation of citizens.",
            "It's a policy that sells well to a domestic audience, but it also stokes an underlying racism that is often reinforced by media coverage. The Australians \"rescued\" were at first quarantined 5,300 kilometers away from Sydney in an offshore camp on Christmas Island, a place that was previously used to incarcerate refugees seeking asylum in Australia. This unnecessarily heightened the perceptions that COVID-19 was an infection of disastrous proportions. Later groups were quarantined on the mainland in Australia's most remote capital city, Darwin, 3,000 kilometers from Sydney.",
            "The Europeans and South Koreans are scrambling to handle the spread of COVID-19. Rather than developing sound management plans by tapping into Chinese expertise, as recommended by the WHO,it appears some countries have been caught flat-footed. While it may be more difficult for countries with more fractious political systems to implement strict quarantine management, it is not impossible.",
            "Unfortunately, the national reaction in some countries feeds both xenophobia and racism. So the key question becomes not \"What is the national response?\" but \"What is our individual response?\". This personal response moves beyond any national response or personal contribution to broader initiatives such as non-government mercy flights to deliver medical equipment.",
            "It's commonly accepted that relationships are essential to developing business in China. Long lunches, numerous alcohol toasts and the elaborate gift-giving courtesies around business all attest to the importance of maintaining these relationships. But for many outside of China, these relationships seem to be lacking substance. Often, they are learned dance-steps, tolerated but without genuine meaning.",
            "It takes a crisis like COVID-19 to stress-test the relationship. What will you do when you are asked to assist with sourcing medical equipment, masks, medical aprons and other items? An outright refusal to assist inflicts deep scars.",
            "Have you enquired about the wellbeing of your key contacts and their families, or have your enquiries then shifted quickly to questions about the resumption of supply and trade for your business?Trade will resume, but it may not be on the same terms as before if your questions have revealed you have greater concerns about profits than about health.",
            "Do you call this disease coronavirus or the Wuhan or China Flu? Your choice of terminology can inflict unintended damage on your future business because your Chinese partners are sensitive at this time to the underlying racism in the Western media coverage of the outbreak.",
            "Compare and contrast the commentary you hear in the street and on Western social media with the chatter on WeChat. For your Chinese colleagues this is a national emergency and it is the duty of citizens to assist, to follow quarantine instructions and to avoid spreading rumors and misinformation.There is a clear sense of national unity and pride in the measures undertaken by Chinese authorities.",
            "China's response to the COVID-19 is different to the response to the SARS outbreak. It is an uninvited test of political maturity. And yet, it has been greeted with border closures and racism despite the WHO saying these measures are both unnecessary and counterproductive. The China response stands in stark contrast to H1N1 swine flu which originated in the borderlands of the United States and Mexico, infecting more than 1,600,000 people in 214 countries with a 17 percent mortality rate leading to more than 284,000 deaths.",
            "So, it's crunch time for your business relationship with China. If your relationship is tested and found to be Jiu Rou Peng You (, or wine and meat friend), then you can expect it to be much more difficult to grow business back to pre-COVID-19 levels when the China recovers. Friends help friends, particularly in times of crisis. Every bit you contribute will be appreciated and remembered. You might not be able to do much, but every bit can count even when it starts just with a change in attitude and a genuine enquiry about the health and safety of your Chinese colleagues.",

            "First, a caveat: nobody yet knows the definitive answers to these questions. The COVID-19 coronavirus is new, the world's leading experts admit there is much they still have to learn, and the disease will have to run its course before we can have complete figures.",
            "Working from the data available, scientists have gone as far as to say it is likely that the mortality rate may end up being lower than 1 percent, albeit increasing to between 8 and 9 percent for those over 80 years old. That would mean more than a 90 percent recovery rate even for octogenarians.",
            "For comparison, the fatality rate of seasonal flu averages 0.1 percent, but of a much bigger number  a total so difficult to estimate that the U.S.-based Center for Disease Control suggests influenza causes \"between nine million and 45 million illnesses\" annually in the U.S. alone, while the World Health Organization (WHO) blames seasonal flu for \"about 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths\" globally per year.",
            "The time-lapse problem",
            "One important thing to consider is the lag between reporting and death. A WHO report in late February noted that the time between symptom onset and fatality ranged between two and eight weeks; even at its shortest, with the rapidly rising number of cases, there will be a delay, which could significantly distort the mortality rate.",
            "On Monday 9 March, the WHO reported an ongoing total of 3,809 deaths from 109,577 confirmed cases, which on bare numbers  dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases  represents a 3.47 percent death rate.",
            "Two weeks previously, those numbers were 2,618 deaths from 79,331 cases; that represents 3.3 percent fatality, but more statistically importantly it means that in the past two weeks alone there have been another 30,246 cases, each of which must run its course before scientists can claim an accurate mortality rate.",
            "But where might the spread be by then? Eight weeks ago  on 13 January, the day the first case was confirmed outside China  the WHO hadn't even started compiling its regular statistical updates, but there had been just one death from around 42 cases. If two weeks is a long time in this outbreak, eight weeks makes a world of difference.",
            "Fluctuations through reporting",
            "Even with that epidemiological asterisk, scientists have been estimating the mortality rate. After preliminary suggestions that it was around 2 percent. In early March, the WHO suggested it was 3.4 percent of reported cases.",
            "However, the WHO says about 80 percent of those with the infection only experience mild symptoms; they are therefore less likely to be tested  and to be counted among the case numbers. As diagnostic capacity increases, we will get a truer sense of the actual number of infections  which should drive the mortality rate down.",
            "This is more than just a statistical hunch. In some countries where testing has been more widespread, mortality rates appear to be lower. South Korea, for example, has carried out tests on more than 1,100 people for every one million; its official mortality rate has been calculated at around 0.68 percent.",
            "On the other hand, in the U.S., where initially limited testing capacity prompted a strategy of focusing on more severe symptoms, the mortality rate rose above 5 percent. That may well come down significantly as more diagnostic kits become available.",
            "However, Italy is an outlier. Despite aggressive testing, the country's mortality rate currently stands at around 5 percent. That doesn't necessarily mean the virus is more deadly there than in other countries and regions: Italy's own testing strategy, for example, could explain the higher percentage and this figure may even out over time.",
            "Underlying demographics",
            "It is also possible that demographics play a role, though. The elderly seem to be more vulnerable, and Italy's population is one of the oldest in the world. Many other European countries are also ageing societies, which is worrying health experts.",
            "Other vulnerable groups are those with underlying health issues. Again, it is important to stress that no figures are complete at this stage. Nonetheless, early reports from the outbreak suggest around 40 percent of people who were hospitalized with coronavirus had a heart condition.",
            "The New England Journal of Medicine looked at 1,099 cases from the outbreak epicenter of Wuhan as of 29 January and found that those with diabetes, higher blood pressure, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B, cancer and renal disease were more likely to get sicker. (The report is here, with details at the bottom of Table 1.)",
            "Experts say conditions that people will be more vulnerable to stronger symptoms if they conditions which lower the strength of the body's immune system or hamper the workings of the lungs. That includes asthma, which the WHO says is \"most common chronic disease among children worldwide,\" afflicting \"around 235 million people.\"",
            "Some preliminary numbers",
            "It's difficult to make a clear assessment of vulnerability. Drilling down into the statistics is tricky: not only is COVID-19 a fast-moving, widespread outbreak, but not every health authority collects or releases the same amount of detail on case sufferers.",
            "However, on 29 February Worldometers.info analyzed the best data available from two major sources: the 28 February report of the WHO-China Joint Mission based on 55,924 laboratory-corroborated cases (which Worldometers calls \"confirmed cases\") and a 17 February paper by the Chinese CCDC based on 72,314 confirmed, suspected, and asymptomatic cases in China (\"all cases\").",
            "The CCDC \"all cases\" report suggested a strong correlation between age and COVID-19 mortality. The death rate for each decade under 50 was well below 1 percent, rising to 1.3 percent for victims in their 50s, through 3.6 percent for 60-somethings and 8 percent for those in their 70s, to 14.8 percent for those aged 80 or above.",
            "Analyzing by sex, Worldometers could call upon both studies, each of which showed a pronounced rise in mortality for men compared with women. The \"all cases\" CCDC study reported 2.8 percent of male cases and 1.7 percent of female victims dying, while the Joint Mission \"confirmed cases\" study reported 4.7 percent for men and 2.8 percent for women. It has been suggested that this may be because smoking in China is much more prevalent among men.",
            "Finally, pre-existing conditions. Again, both reports can be used as source data and, while statisticians must always be careful not to confuse correlation with causation, there are definitely strong links between some pre-existing conditions and a higher mortality rate.",
            "Worst of all is cardiovascular disease, with a 13.2 percent mortality rate among confirmed cases. Diabetes (9.2 percent), hypertension (8.4 percent), chronic respiratory disease (8 percent) and cancer (7.6 percent) also correlate with higher mortality rates  broadly matched, if at a slightly lower level, by the deeper but earlier \"all cases\" data.",
            "So, it seems there are general themes to be pulled out of these figures, if with some uncertainty until those February figures are corroborated: men are more at risk, age plays a notable part and so do some pre-existing conditions.",
            "However, perhaps we should also heed the words of the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who wants us to keep it simple. \"The death rate from this outbreak is high. We shouldn't categorize by young or senior,\" he told reporters on Monday.",
            "\"Of course, to understand the epidemiology, it's fine to do that,\" he continued. \"But for action, I think every life matters. This is a moral decay if we try to categorize it that way: a moral decay of society.\""

The Washington Post accused China of carrying out political retribution by using the epidemic as cover. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross saw the disease as an opportunity to \"accelerate the return of jobs to North America.\" His colleague, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, used a diplomatic trip in late January to brand China as the \"central threat of our times,\" just as the country was mobilizing to contain the outbreak.",

Despite the 8.3-billion-dollar emergency funding bill passed through Congress, the country's two political parties are engaged in a fist fight, accusing each other of bungling the response to the disease. President Donald Trump said the outbreak is the Democrats' \"new hoax\" and accused them of \"fearmongering.\" Speaker of House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the administration of manufacturing \"needless chaos\" and \"hampering the government's response.\"",
            "Truth be told, hashtag 2020election alone is a powerful enough incentive for both sides to politicize, well, everything.",
            "Vox, a U.S. news and opinion website, published an article clearly stating \"Trump's view of the coronavirus as a political rather than health-based issue.\" Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" was an economically centered platform. The country's economic development under his administration would either be his strength or his Achilles heel in his re-election campaign. And the record-setting drops of the market aren't exactly welcoming news to a president who has been constantly prodding for more growth. Fear would exacerbate the situation. Picking a partisan fight and accusing the Democrats as fearmongering is a fitting political strategy to divert people's attention away from the virus and shift the blame.",
            "Also, the year hasn't been easy for Democrats in their quest to defeat Trump in the upcoming election. Impeachment handed him his highest approval rating since his inauguration in 2017, reaching 94 percent amongst Republicans, according to a Gallup poll. Support for his removal went from 52 percent in favor in October 2019 to 52 percent against at the end of the process. As Washington Post columnist Marc A. Thiessen wrote: \"For Democrats, this is the very definition of failure.\" By the way, the election-count debacle in Iowa wasn't confidence-inciting either.",
            "The Trump administration's response to the virus is really handing an opening to the Democrats on a silver platter. The Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, during his COVID-19 hearing on Capitol Hill, demonstrated a shocking lack of preparedness that even Republican Senator John Kennedy was visibly irritated. Trump's own talk about \"the tests are all perfect\" doesn't juxtapose well with statements about a shortage of test kits coming from populous states like New York and California.",
            "Since last week, Secretary Pompeo started using \"Wuhan virus\" in his public remarks, against the World Health Organization's explicit opposition to such a designation. Making the name stick would redirect public dissatisfaction toward China, thereby taking the heat from the country's internal political brawl and botched response to the disease.

            "Chinese researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology have applied for a national patent on an experimental drug developed by an American biotech firm that the scientists believe has the potential to fight the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV.",
            "The antiviral drug Remdesivir, developed by U.S. firm Gilead Sciences, was earlier approved by Chinese authorities for a clinical trial which began Thursday. A total of 761 coronavirus patients across several hospitals in Wuhan are enrolled for the first phase of trials, led by the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and the Institute of Materia Medica under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS)",
            "The clinical trial of the drug has been approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the National Health Commission and the National Medical Products Administration, Xinhua News Agency reported.",
            "Remdesivir will be administered to 453 critical patients and 308 less severe patients, Cao Bin, head of the drug's clinical trial program said Wednesday at a press conference hosted by MOST at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, which is also enrolled on the trial.",
            "Remdesivir was developed by Gilead as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg virus infections, though the drug has subsequently showed reasonable antiviral activity against SARS and MERS coronavirus in previous cell and animal experiments.",
            "While the experimental drug hasn't completed all clinical trials abroad and isn't licensed or approved anywhere in the world, the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China has made a compelling case for Remdesivir's human trials on coronavirus patients after it showed early signs of being highly effective.",
            "\"Its clinical trials against Ebola infections have been conducted abroad. In related domestic research, it has also shown fairly good antiviral activity against the 2019-nCoV at the cellular level,\" Cao asserted.",
            "\"Hopes have been pinned on the drug, but we have to wait for results of its actual effectiveness in the clinical trials,\" said Wang Chen, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of the CAMS.",
            "Other potential drugs",
            "Besides Remdesivir, researchers have also found some other drugs with seemingly positive results in the treatment of the 2019-nCoV. These included Chloroquine phosphate and Favipiravir, as well as some traditional Chinese medicines that contain active antiviral ingredients as drug candidates, for further animal experiments and clinical trials, the Global Times reported.",
            "Earlier this week China's National Health Commission announced several medical institutions were studying the possibility of clinical trials for other potential antiviral drugs that could help in the fight against the 2019-nCoV pathogen.",
            "Related story: Researchers find two new drugs that can effectively inhibit coronavirus",
            "\"Information and data of clinical trials for Lopinavir and Ritonavir and traditional Chinese medicines are being collected,\" NHC spokesperson Song Shuli was quoted as saying by Xinhua.",
            "The NHC has issued a trial plan for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus, Song said, adding that the plan offers detailed information of the medicines, both traditional Chinese medicines and Western medicines, used in the treatment of the disease.",
            "Li Lanjuan, a top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Engineering, also announced on Tuesday that her team has verified two kinds of effective medicines against the 2019-nCoV named Arbidol and Darunavir.",
            "'Patent application out of national interest'",
            "Meanwhile, the Wuhan Institute of Virology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences claimed that their researchers have found two medicines  Remdesivir and Chloroquine  that \"effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus.\"",
            "In a statement released on its website on Tuesday, the institute said it has applied for a patent in China for the use of Remdesivir in treating coronavirus patients. The application was made on January 21 jointly by the researchers from Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, according to the statement.",
            "Chloroquine, on the other hand, has been used to treat malaria since the 1940s. It has been sold on the Chinese market and can be independently provided, according to the institute.",
            "The patent application triggered heated discussions on Chinese social media, with users expressing concerns over intellectual property rights, the Global Times reported. Some questioned the institute's eligibility to patent a medicine made by a U.S. company in China.",
            "Gilead Sciences, in an email to the Global Times, however clarified that they have reached agreement with China's health authorities to carry out two clinical trials on patients infected with the coronavirus in order to make sure whether the drug is safe and effective in treating the virus.",
            "In order to prevent, treat and control epidemic diseases, the Chinese National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) can grant compulsory licenses in a national emergency and extraordinary situation to protect the public's interests, Chen Jihong, an expert in patent law at the Beijing Zhonglun Law Firm, told the Global Times.",
            "If the Wuhan Institute's patent application is approved, Gilead would need to get the Chinese institute on board in sales of Remdesivir for treating 2019-nCoV patients outside China. But, the U.S. drug manufacturer will retain the global rights to market the medication, once approved, in treating Ebola and SARS for which the drug was originally developed.",
            "The Wuhan Institute has urged foreign companies to withhold enforcing lawful patent rights to assist China's fight against the coronavirus epidemic. The institute said in its statement that it made the patent application out of national interest, and won't exercise its patent rights if foreign pharmaceutical firms cooperate with China to curb the epidemic.",
            "While the American firm didn't make any statement on Wuhan Institute's patent application, Chinese experts and lawyers felt that the application is reasonable and in line with the Patent Law of China. Gilead only lays claims to Remdesivir's chemical compounds, while the Wuhan institute has applied for methods of use regarding the pharmaceutical product, some of them told the Global Times.",
            "\"The good thing in having a patent is that it would lead to cross-licensing situations that give China more bargaining chips in negotiating the licensing fee with Gilead,\" Wang Yanyu, a senior partner at AllBright Law Offices in Beijing, told the Bloomberg news agency.",
            "Wang added that filing of the patent application by a stakeholder in China makes perfect sense. \"Most of the patients are here, rather than in the U.S., which makes it unlikely that Gilead will do all these tests,\" he said."

            "Editor's note: It's a hard time for everyone, with the coronavirus outbreak showing few signs of abating. This has caused fear and wrath while testing the resilience and empathy of many people. In this life-and-death battle, some are working relentlessly to save lives, some are stuck at home overloaded by the barrage of real-time information, while others are struggling to make a living despite the risks.",
            "In this series \"Faces Fighting Coronavirus,\" we take a look at people from different walks of life who are affected by the outbreak as well as those who are trying to keep their lives as normal as they can to keep our society running.",
            "Our first episode focuses on how farmers are faring during the coronavirus outbreak.",
            "For 21-year-old Zhang Haomin, this Spring Festival has been one of the grimmest for her family business in more than 20 years. \"Every Lunar New Year holiday is the peak season for selling fruits, but things changed a lot this year,\" she told CGTN.",
            "Zhang resigned from her job in Beijing just before the festival and came back to her hometown in Shunping County in Baoding, a city in northern Hebei Province. Her home village Wulang has a history of strawberry farming, and most villagers make a living that way. But an abundant harvest last year only fueled their worries.",
            "\"Usually we can make ends meet for all the cost in a year during this festive time, but things don't look so good this year.\" Having grown strawberries for over two decades, her family has five big greenhouses. \"Once we pick [the strawberries], they will rot quickly,\" she said.",
            "Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Wulang was hunkered down on the second day of the 2020 Lunar New Year to reduce the risk for the villagers to get infected.",
            "On the first day of lockdown, Zhang's family lowered the price of the fruit from 50 to 16 yuan per kilogram, but since her grandfather couldn't leave to sell the strawberries in town nor bring them to vendors, their efforts have seen little success.",
            "So Zhang resorted to something that her family hasn't tried before  selling online. She began selling the strawberries on WeChat Moments and then opened an account on an app called Xianyu, Alibaba's e-commerce platform for selling second-hand goods. \"Some 60 percent of customers just come to support me as they heard farmers are in a difficult time over the outbreak,\" said Zhang, adding that most of the buyers are her former colleagues in Beijing. They're even introducing her to new customers. \"They make me feel warm during this bleak season.\"",
            "But cordoned off roads pose a tremendous logistical challenge. She could only send off strawberries to customers living in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei as it now takes four times longer than usual to ship to places outside of the region.",
            "Turning ripened strawberries into canned jelly is another way to keep them from piling up and rotting.",
            "Zhang and her strawberry planting neighbors aren't the only farmers left out in the cold amid the outbreak.",
            "Yu Junhua, a pig breeder from Dongying in coastal Shandong Province, said his pigs would soon run out of feed due to the traffic restrictions. His town  Xihua  has sealed off all outbound roads.",
            "In order to pick up the animal feed from a nearby city, he has to apply for a transit pass to cross the checkpoints. But there are no clear guidelines from the municipal government on how to apply for the pass, nor is there any guarantee that he will get a pass even if he applies.",
            "With assistance from an animal feed factory, Yu managed to secure a transit pass to the nearby city of Binzho, but he was then informed that most feed factories in the city had been closed down due to a lack of raw materials. Though Shandong is a major corn producer, soybean meal  another crucial element in animal feed  needs to be sourced elsewhere. And with major routes shut down, the supply can't keep up with the surge in demand.",
            "With only five days of feed left for his pigs, Yu said he planned to feed corn to his herd so that they won't starve to death. But this is no long-term solution: Pigs that eat nothing but corn grow slower and are likely to get sick.",
            "Yu suffered a devastating loss last year due to the African Swine Fever (ASF)  two-thirds of his herd was gone. The coronavirus outbreak is now dealing with another heavy blow, but Yu said the damage was more manageable compared with the ASF.",
            "\"With the ASF, one could go bankrupt overnight,\" Yu told CGTN. \"At least the coronavirus didn't kill the pigs.\"",
            "Inside Yu's village, strict disinfection measures were implemented at the pig farms: Every household is required to report its family members' travel history, and those who had been to Hubei Province would be quarantined immediately. Across the village, instructions on how to avoid the coronavirus are regularly broadcasted from loudspeakers.",
            "Yu was hopeful that traffic restrictions would be eased for pig farmers like him, who sustain the country's food supply. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on Tuesday that free passage of delivery trucks carrying animal feed and poultry should be protected. But the exclusion of aquatic products makes Li Chuang a little bit disappointed.",
            "In east China's landlocked province of Anhui, which borders Hubei to the west, Li, a self-employed fisherman at Fukang Aquaculture Cooperative in Fuyang's Taihe County, is facing more challenges.",
            "\"Two trucks of my fish were pulled over at a checkpoint on the road from Bozhou to Fuyang,\" Li told CGTN in a phone interview.",
            "Given the quarantine measures taken as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, transportation has been gravely affected. The government has opened \"green channels\" for farm produce transportation in order to protect farmers, fishermen and to ensure daily food supply for consumers. Farmers can apply for a transportation permit from the local transportation department but villagers are nervous. \"Didn't Zhong Nanshan encourage people to stay home?\"",
            "Affected by the outbreak, live poultry and seafood markets in many places were shut down. Plus, Banquets and wedding ceremonies typical of the Lunar New Year in rural areas were all canceled. A few supermarkets still in operation can only relieve part of the inventory.",
            "\"We can no longer set up a stall at bus stations. I lost hundreds of thousands of yuan in revenue in the past month,\" Li said.",
            "For fishermen such as Li, who's been in the fish fry business for 10 years, spring is the prime season. However, it's been difficult distributing the fry across counties due to travel restrictions, as well as finding workers who can help put the fry into the fishponds before it gets warmer. Fry survival would usually be low at higher temperatures.",
            "Because of the difficulties in bulk goods transportation, the agriculture bureau of Yixing in east China's Jiangsu Province suggested that fishermen increase door-to-door sales of aquatic products through community group purchases. Some fishermen have started selling aquatic products on WeChat, and many fishermen have resorted to professional logistics companies such as SF Express to transport their products.",
            "According to Mao Ying, director of Yixing's fishery and poultry station, there are still about 30,000 acres of fishponds with a stockpile of aquatic products in Yixing, which equals to more than 8,000 tons of aquatic products.",
            "\"We are encouraging fishermen to sell online,\" said Mao. \"If all these stocks are left here, it may cost tens of millions of yuan  that's the worst-case scenario.\" However, Mao, who has been working on mitigating the damages caused by the coronavirus outbreak on aquaculture since January, is optimistic. \"But hopefully, that couldn't be the worst-case scenario.\"",

            "As containing COVID-19 becomes a reality across Europe, countries are taking extreme measures to minimize infection. On Saturday, French health minister Olivier Veranasked his compatriots to avoid handshakes and kiss greetings.",
            "After 16 new cases of the coronavirus were recorded in France, the government has also closed many schools, banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces and asked citizens to wash their hands thoroughly - but it is perhaps the advice to avoid handshakes, hugs and kisses that is the biggest culture shock.",
            "This health advice clashes with the country's traditionally tactile culture, and France isn't alone in this. In the European country where most cases have been recorded, Italy, all those friendly gestures regarded as so typically Italian are now being discouraged.",
            "The effects of COVID-19 go beyond national culture into religious practice. In Italian churches, the fear of contagion has overruled the ritualistic handshake in the name of peace and solidarity between worshipers - and the ceremony of the holy communion hand-to-mouth is now frowned upon.",
            "As global media broadcasts images of public officials and medical staff in masks and containment suits while fighting COVID-19, Europeans are left confused about where the line is between reasonable precaution and panic, even if the case for avoiding direct contact with other people is legitimate.",
            "But a case can also be made for keeping an appearance of normality in times of crisis. Old habits die hard: the French, the Italians, or the Spanish are unlikely to suddenly deny their families and friends a gesture that has so much meaning in their countries' everyday life.",
            "What's in a kiss? The origin and significance of the kiss greeting",
            "In our globalized world it is quite common for a Spanish person to meet a British one, for a German to hang out with a Brazilian, for a Japanese to work with an Italian.",
            "And where one might greet a friend or a colleague with a wave, the other might go for a simple nod or a handshake, a kiss on the cheek or maybe two, or even a hug. And it's not always easy to coordinate the same ritual.",
            "Given the importance of first impressions, being introduced to someone new can already be nerve-wracking, when the greeting has the potential to turn into an awkward experience.",
            "Even among countries that share the tradition of kiss greeting  and this goes from European to Latin American countries and some parts of the Middle East and Asia - the rules to the ritual are not the same everywhere, with many a potential faux pas.",
            "If you're faced with a kiss greeting the first time you're ever meeting someone in Europe, it's very likely that the person in front of you will be French. If an Italian greets you with two cheek kisses, they probably consider you a friend.",
            "All these kisses are rarely lip-to-cheek kisses, but they're normally 'air kisses' and equal to a grazing of the cheek.",
            "It's a ritualistic act in which closeness to the other person, gender dynamics and tradition all play a role.",
            "While giving one kiss is common in Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Peru and the Philippines, in Europe it would probably make people uncomfortable.",
            "Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia and France all share the tradition of giving two kisses  though the number of kisses changes region by region in France and there's even a website recording how many kisses to expect where - but whereas all of these countries start on the right cheek, the Italians start on the left: a formula for social disaster.",
            "Three kisses are shared as a greeting in Belgium, Ukraine, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Slovenia, the Netherlands and Switzerland.",
            "The origin of kiss-greeting are almost lost in a faraway ancestral past, but there's agreement among the experts that the Romans were the ones who made it popular and exported the ritual across Europe.",
            "The Romans' osculum - a kiss shared for greeting each other to show politeness and courtesy - gained popularity across Europe and became tied up in various customs from country to country. On 16 July 1439, as the plague spread across England, King Henry VI was forced to ban kissing to avoid contagion  sound familiar?",
            "Henry's ban was ineffective, and non-romantic kissing returned, to a greater or lesser extent, in most cultures. This interestingly personal ritual has now stubbornly survived for centuries, through increased levels of hygiene and etiquette awareness, defeating even the rising importance set on the concepts of physical boundaries.",
            "The reasons can be found in the values it represents: a kiss on the cheek is a way to offer someone a warm welcome, to show them friendship and affection, to establish a certain degree of closeness to someone.",
            "France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and all the other countries where is common to greet someone with kisses are all cultures where human contact is a fundamental part of the national character. The greeting kiss, the physical proximity, the occasional hand on the shoulder are all ways in which these countries express the idea of being sociable.",
            "It might seem like a little thing to give up, a basic health measure: but for the people who kiss their friends and families hello and goodbye, avoiding this deeply entrenched gesture is equivalent to rejecting a social ritual that has been establishing and reinforcing relationships through all their life.",

By evening, he made a little over 300 yuan (43 U.S. dollars), after driving around the capital for more than 12 hours. This was a good day.",
            "On a regular day, Wang said he can make 500-600 yuan. Now since people haven't been leaving their homes, the 47-year-old has seen his daily earnings halved, he told CGTN.",
            "Drivers like Wang have to shell out a management fee of some 200 yuan a day on average to taxi companies in order to operate the vehicles, whether they are working or not. Setting aside the basic expenses, including gas, there is little if anything left for the driver to take home over the last few weeks.",
            "\"I see no one hailing taxis from the street or on the internet. In the last hour I haven't had one passenger. And the car is burning gas,\" Wang said.",

            "Zhang said these issues are affecting taxi drivers all over the country. In Shanghai, taxi companies have lowered the rental fee by 80-120 yuan a day to ease drivers' burden. More cities are following suit with reductions, some more substantial than others.",
            "Last week, one city in east China's Zhejiang, another province hard-hit by COVID-19 outbreak after Hubei, waived the fee for drivers who are sickened by the coronavirus or unable to work due to quarantine measures.",

            "A handful of taxi companies own all registered cabs in Beijing, as in 85 percent of Chinese cities.",
            "Taxis contributed 28 percent of all traffic flow in China's cities. But the drivers have been scrambling to save their livelihoods for years since ride-hailing apps have become mainstream in the country.",
            "That doesn't mean their jobs are less important, especially in times of crisis. After the lockdown of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, 6,000 local taxis have been enlisted to serve as emergency vehicles for communities citywide. Under an effective transport ban, these designated taxis can be a life saver for those in need of medical attention.",
            "With people returning to work, it also means more competition for customers from private drivers, who share the same ride-hailing platforms with taxi drivers to receive online bookings but offer more options in terms of price and comfort. \"More private cars in the street means less jobs for us,\" Wang noted.",
            "In the wake of the outbreak, these jobs come with increased risks of contracting the deadly coronavirus. While most workers are told to avoid close proximity with other people, taxi drivers are lining up to pick up passengers in crowded places. For many, money is not the only concern.",

            "Hoaxes about the novel coronavirus outbreak have spread widely online. Promoted by conspiracy theorists, fake news websites and unsuspecting members of the public, the fake news compounds the struggle to contain the virus, which has already claimed hundreds of lives and infected thousands. \"The 2019-nCoV outbreak and response has been accompanied by a massive 'infodemic' - an over-abundance of information, some accurate and some not - that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it,\" according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report.",
            "The sentiment was echoed by China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, who took aim at reports which contain \"malicious slander and disinformation,\" adding that \"rumors and panic are more frightening than the virus itself.\"",
            "What fake news stories have been spread?",
            "While certain falsehoods or myths around the novel coronavirus are relatively harmless - the WHO recently debunked the idea that the illness could be cured by garlic, sesame oil and vitamin C - many more of them come from sites and networks with a history of spreading fake news. The anti-vaccine movement and far-right conspiracy theorists are said to have been been partly responsible for spreading falsehoods and misinformation has been published on sites that pose as news outlets.The false stories have taken aim at a range of targets, from Bill Gates and the Chinese military to online influencers in Wuhan \"eating bats.\"The misinformation on Bill Gates, published on InfoWars and spread by QAnon conspiracy theorists, stems from a 2015 patent request for a form of coronavirus, which was issued from a disease research facility. The facility, based in the UK, is partly funded by the Microsoft founder. In an attempt to stifle the misinformation, the facility in question issued a statement noting that the patent related to the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which only affects poultry.",

            "Conspiracy theories can emerge from audiences having \"seen the word coronavirus out there and assume that must be [referring to] the new coronavirus,\" says Jessica McDonald, science writer at factcheck.org - a partner of Facebook.\"People have twisted these existing patent documents to say 'oh OK, these companies knew about it or governments knew about it,'\" McDonald notes.Misinformation often originates from people with ulterior motives, but its proliferation is dependent on the prejudices of audiences. A video of a woman eating bat soup was shared widely across social media in the first weeks of the outbreak. The video was promoted by fake news sites and international media alike, with many linking the eating of bat soup to the outbreak - an unproven theory which has only been speculated on by scientists.Researchers from The Observers, a fact-checking operation for France 24, discovered that none of the six videos shared were linked to the outbreak, many were filmed several years ago, and five of them were recorded outside China, mostly in Palau or Indonesia.",
            "Unique challenges of fake news on coronavirus",
            "To understand the novel coronavirus requires a depth of knowledge that many journalists and audiences do not have. McDonald says it can be hard for audiences who \"don't have a basic scientific background,\" who are then presented with stories that \"are making claims that may seem plausible.\"If you know anything about it you can tell that they've twisted this into something that's not related at all and you don't need to worry about it. But for people who are just looking at it online, they might be browsing online - it's not immediately obvious.\"A lot of this misinformation is more challenging in that regard, it appears scientific, or can be, even when it's not based in fact.\"",
            "How are big tech companies reacting?",
            "As with previous cases of widespread misinformation, social media platforms are being pressured to identify and remove fake news on the novel coronavirus. The largest platform with some 2.9 billion users, Facebook, which also owns Instagram, announced it would remove \"false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities.\"The move represents a change in policy for the social media giant, which has come under sustained criticism for allowing misinformation to proliferate on its platform.The company has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year. The spread of illness there was so severe that the company classified anti-vaccination content a risk of physical harm. The decisions indicate that Facebook is expanding its understanding of \"physical harm,\" a ground for a post's removal on the platform, to include misinformation around an illness.",

In China, where accurate information about the virus is more crucial than anywhere else, social media is also battling fake news. A spokeswoman for WeChat, which has 1 billion Chinese users, told Reuters the company was removing posts containing coronavirus-related misinformation.",

            "Researchers and medical officials have noted a trend of stories urging readers to purchase medicine claiming to be able to fight the novel coronavirus. McDonald warns that \"One thing we are seeing now especially these ideas of miracles cures for the virus, which do not exist. If anything is asking you to buy something, that should be a red flag.\"McDonald urges audiences to be patient when it comes to consuming news. Stories breaking on Facebook or Twitter don't automatically mean they're false, \"but if you don't hear about it eventually from a major news organisation then there's probably reason to believe that it's not real.\"",

            "While the novel coronavirus has thoroughly infiltrated Europe, the continent's countries have remained studiously committed to combating the virus. What's more demonstrative of their resolve to confront the epidemic is the solidarity that they have shown in the past few weeks, for example their refusal to suspend the Schengen Agreement. Governments in Italy, Germany, and France, the countries that have been hit the hardest by the virus, have been closely monitoring the situation and taking far-reaching, corresponding steps.",
            "Italy: 416 confirmed cases, 79 deaths",
            "The number of virus infections in Italy assumes a staggering lead over other European countries. The outbreak emerged last week, 60 kilometers from Italy's financial capital Milan. Authorities identified a cluster of towns in Lombardy and a smaller zone in the neighboring region of Veneto as the epicenter of the flare-up and placed 50,000 inhabitants under quarantine.",
            "They also implemented a general clampdown across much of the affluent north, ordering the closure of universities, museums, theaters and cinemas, leading to an exodus of tourists and business travelers and triggering fears of a likely recession.",

            "As the region scrambles to contain further infiltration by the virus, strains on its public health sector have been exposed to the public. A shortage of required equipment for intensive care has been highlighted as hospitals in the hardest-hit region have been overwhelmed by patients. This has led hospitals to take several contingent measures, including postponing non-essential surgeries and transferring patients to other hospitals.",
            "Private hospitals in Lombardy have offered up beds in intensive care units (ICU) and more than a dozen doctors from the private sector have agreed to work in public hospitals to ease the crisis, regional president Attilio Fontana said. Regional authorities have asked Lombardy's hospitals to reduce by 70 percent their planned or elective surgeries, to free up ICU beds for virus patients.",
            "In an effort to cope with what many have described an insufficient number of hospital personnel, the regional authorities have been pushing for the early graduation of nurses and reaching out to retired medical workers for help. Desperate for staff reinforcement, hospital personnel already on the front lines told reporters that any qualified medical worker is immensely welcomed regardless of their age or experience in the field.",
            "Meanwhile, medical workers have also been facing great risks when tending to COVID-19 patients. According to Italian health officials, about 10 percent of them in Lombardy have been infected and an estimated 5 percent of confirmed cases occurring on hospital personnel.",
            "In spite of this, Italy's large elderly population is also of grave concern as the disease proves to be exceptionally lethal for people over the age of 65, a demographic which accounts for 23 percent of the overall population in the country. This is particularly contributing to the number of deaths caused by the disease.",

            "Diamond Princess, a luxury cruise ship operated by Princess Cruises, docked at Yokohama port in Japan, brewed the largest coronavirus outbreak at sea. After the first case of coronavirus infection was confirmed, it took Japanese officials 72 hours to impose a lockdown.",
            "It was chaos that ruled the cruise line during the two-week quarantine  there was no virus-control protocols, and the procession to conduct virus testing was slow. Media report shows that as the cruise line docked Yokohama port in Japan and medical officials were on board to screen some passengers in their rooms, many other were still mingling freely, eating buffets and attending theater performances.",
            "According to a New York Times report that documented the details of the quarantine measures on the cruise, passengers were not advised to keep a distance from each other until the second day after the confirmed case was exposed and it was only until the fifth day that passengers were offered N95 masks.",
            "On top of that, the crew members, who were the ones most exposed to infections, were not given proper protections. They did not sleep in separate rooms, and they worked in close ranges and eat at tables of 14 for meals. Even officials responsible for screening passengers and crew members were infected. Many of them did not wear protective gears and had no experience in dealing with epidemic.",

            "As news of the Diamond Princess came, fears arose that MS Westerdam might have someone on board with the virus. The ship was turned away by one port after another, before Cambodia finally allowed it to dock after two weeks.",
            "Cambodian government organized testing for the passengers and crew members on board. Those who were cleared of infection were allowed to disembark and headed to different places across the world. Yet as thousands were leaving, one American passenger who left the ship earlier was found to be tested positive for the virus when she arrived in Malaysia.",
            "Officials scrambled to call back those who have left and imposed quarantine on others who were still on the ship. Confusion, chaos and frustration were reported to be the mood surrounding the cruise ship. Some of those who disembarked earlier roamed around the city of Phnom Penh freely before being told to seek self-quarantine.",
            "Luckily, the former passenger who was initially diagnosed with COVID-19 was later proved to be cleared of the virus. All crew members and passengers were tested negative and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared passengers from the MS Westerdam to be at \"no risk\"or \"low risk\"of coronavirus infection.",
            "In the coastal city of Tianjin, located 112 kilometers southeast of Beijing, the handling of a similar emergency on a cruise ship is completely different.",
            "On January 24, authorities in Tianjin were informed that Costa Serena, a cruise ship carrying 3,706 passengers and 1,100 crew members that departed from Tianjin four days ago, had 15 feverish passengers.",
            "In the early morning of January 25, Tianjin municipal government ordered the ship to drop anchor outside Tianjin port and instructed quarantine officials to come to the port to carry out inspections.",

            "In the afternoon, all samples tested negative and everyone aboard was cleared of the coronavirus. In 24 hours, all emergency response measures related to Costa Serena were completed.",
            "In an interview with local media, Li Wenpeng, an official at the customs office of Dongjiang Free Trade Port ZoneofTianjin, said the key to managing the crisis at Costa Serena was the quick decision to cancel the cruise's itineraries and to stop 3,700 new passengers from boarding the ship.",
            "Li said, in comparison, the Japanese government did not pay enough attention to the gravity of the situation on Diamond Princess, a lack of timely quarantine measures was the reason why the cruise ship became one of the largest outbreak cluster.",
            "How the situation played out differently in the three cruise ships shows that with resoluteness and quick response, the spread of the virus can be contained in an effective way. At a time of crisis, more accountability on the part of government is called for to battle against the coronavirus."

            "It is a fact that the number of confirmed cases is increasing, and yes, we are using new testing methods. Developing our knowledge of the new virus is also a gradual process.",
            "Q2:Is the new coronavirus more contagious and virulent than SARS and MERS?",
            "A: (Zhong Nanshan, the expert who discovered the SARS virus during an outbreak in China in 2003)",
            "It's not as contagious and virulent as SARS. I think there's a difference between the severity and the spread of the disease between the new coronavirus and SARS.",
            "A: (Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)",
            "Including the new one, there are altogether seven coronaviruses that can infect humans. Of the six already known, four are lowly pathogenic to humans, and everyone knows the other two - SARS and MERS - are quite serious. We are still learning about the new virus.",
            "Q3: How can we contain the virus during the Spring Festival holiday?",
            "A: (Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission)",
            "Because of the high personnel mobility during the Spring Festival, China has raised the epidemic prevention and control to a national level and made institutional arrangements.Governments at all levels in China and various departments have strengthened the implementation of various prevention and control measures. It is recommended that people outside Wuhan should not go to the city, and Wuhan residents should not leave the city without special circumstances.",

            "A: (Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)",
            "We are still in the process of learning more about this virus. It appears to have some characteristics of common coronaviruses but also exhibits some special features. We have confirmed it was transmitted via wild animals illegally sold at a seafood market in Wuhan.At first, it was spread from animals to humans. However, the virus has since been mutating and has become adaptive to its host. Human-to-human transmission has occurred, and there has been some community transmission. That is to say, it has gone through three stages.We are still deepening the study on it. So far, children and young people are less likely to be infected.",
            "Q5: Are there super-spreaders of the coronavirus? As we all know, back in 2003, the emergence of super-spreaders of SARS caused the rapid deterioration of the situation. Will this disease turn out to be another SARS-like epidemic?A: (Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)",
            "There's no evidence to support the idea there are already super-spreaders. This is a scientific issue that we will keep monitoring closely. It's also a very important direction that guides us in the prevention and control of the virus.Note: A super-spreader is a highly contagious virus carrier. It could infect more secondary contacts than other hosts who are also infected with the same disease.",
            "Q6: A study by a UK university estimated that 2,000 people have been infected in China. Have you ever predicted the number of infected people who are not being treated?",
            "A: (Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)",
            "I think any question like that must be based on science. First of all, the calculation, which I also read, is a mathematical model. The number you just asked about is the highest estimate that the model has predicted. In order to know the exact casualty caused by a new virus, facts should be ascertained by the available numbers and it should not be based on theories.",

            "We attach great importance to information disclosure. After the outbreak, the National Health Commission directed the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee to release the latest situation on December 31, 2019, and January 3, 5, and 9, 2020.As the situation has changed, daily updates started on January 11. On January 9, the National Health Commission instantly released the finding that the pathogen is a new type of coronavirus.Recently, cases have been reported in areas outside Wuhan, Hubei Province.

            "Given its linguistic roots, we must hope that any use of \"pandemic\" is an exaggeration. It comes from the Greek words meaning \"all\" (pan) and \"people\" (demos), and a 100 percent global infection rate would be almost as impressive as it would be terrifying.",
            "In practice, the word has been used to describe significant geographical spread over a short time. Usually, it is applied when disease spreads across a wide region, perhaps several continents. A disease that quickly infected every single person in Denmark or Denver would be awful, but it wouldn't be a pandemic: it would, however, be an epidemic.",
            "An epidemic (\"epi\" from the Greek for \"upon\" or \"above\") is characterized by a rapid spread to a large number of people in a short time. Again, the spread rapidity is important: a disease with relatively stable levels, such as cancer, would be endemic (\"en\" from the Greek for \"within\"). Two weeks is a typical benchmark: if coverage becomes widespread within a country or region, it may be regarded as an epidemic.",
            "Again, it's a slippery term without clear definition. The Ebola crisis of 2013-16, which primarily affected the neighboring West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, was widely described as an epidemic; however, a 1,750-word statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) on 7 August 2014, describing it as an \"extraordinary event\" and a capitalized \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern,\" did not once mention the word \"epidemic.\" Only in September, as the case toll climbed, did the WHO begin to use that word. The WHO later faced criticism for the speed of its reaction to the crisis.",
            "An epidemic grows from an outbreak, which can be described as a sudden spike of cases in a localized region  above what may normally be expected (for instance through a typical seasonal variation, as with malaria). With an unknown disease, as few as four cases may be regarded as an outbreak.",
            "A cluster is something of a preliminary term: an accumulation of cases in close proximity and time, which experts suspect is greater than the expected number. Such an occurrence would probably remain a cluster while tests are carried out  and time passes  before possibly escalating to an outbreak, then an epidemic, then a pandemic.",
            "However, the lines between these words are at best loosely defined. US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci declared earlier this month: \"Pandemics mean different things to different people It really is borderline semantics, to be honest with you.\"",
            "The WHO is still stopping short of describing COVID-19 as a pandemic. This could be a strict interpretation of epidemiology: despite thousands of cases in Asia and hundreds in Europe, with just 63 reported cases in North America, one in Africa and one in South America, this cannot (yet?) be described as a wholly global event.",
            "However, it depends how you define globality. The WHO has certainly tried before: in 1999 it explained the six phases of outbreak severity  definitions it revised in 2005 and 2008, the latter just in time for the planet's most recent pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak.",
            "Under that system, a pandemic \"is characterized by community-level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region,\" following \"human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region.\" By that rationale, it seems the only possible block to COVID-19 being a pandemic would be that the Italian lockdown is not yet seen as \"community-level.\"",
            "Hesitancy remains. On Monday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"Our decision about whether to use the word 'pandemic' to describe an epidemic is based on an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole of society.\"",
            "The next day, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic revealed that \"groups in various organizations are working to define 'pandemic' for this novel virus, which could take some time.\" This was underlined by Ghebreyesus: \"We should not be too eager to declare a pandemic without a careful and clear-minded analysis of the facts.\"",
            "Wary of inflaming worldwide worry, authorities are being very careful with language. They did not rush to name the new coronavirus and were careful to do so without linking it to a place or animal, which can increase fear  such as happened with MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a name that inspired mistrust of people from that region) or swine flu (during which outbreak, Egypt slaughtered all its pigs).",
            "READ MORE How viruses are named",
            "As Ghebreyesus insisted on Wednesday: \"Using the word 'pandemic' carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and paralyzing systems. It may also signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true.\"",
            "What is also not true is that the WHO is underestimating or downplaying the virus. Ghebreyesus noted that on 30 January, his organization raised the issue to what he called \"our highest level of alarm\"  a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.",
            "It is, perhaps, a deliberately wordy phrase that cannot easily be thrown around in headlines or loose talk. But such obfuscations carry their own risk. A fortnight after the WHO announced the name COVID-19, most news outlets have reverted to using the more widely known, but technically vague, \"coronavirus.\" Whatever their attempts to control the spread of a disease, authorities can do little to control the public use of language.",

Several businesses, factories and manufacturing units are reopening after the outbreak put a break on their operations for weeks.",
            "While many manufacturers in China are hopeful to achieve a \"full production capacity\" by next month and efforts are on to meet their annual targets, the news of the epidemic spreading globally is proving to be a dampener on their business prospects for the rest of the year.",
            "Soumen Biswas, a Shanghai-based fashion apparel exporter, who partners with several factories across China through a \"smart factory\" initiative, told CGTN that both the workers and manufacturers are driven to make up for the loss and put things back to normal at the earliest. The biggest bottleneck remains a shrunken workforce, as many returning workers must be quarantined for two weeks before entering factories.",
            "\"As far as the fashion industry is concerned, our manufacturers based in provinces like Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have already started working. The workforce is still not in full capacity because they are still in the middle of the coronavirus fear. But I guess that by the end of this month, or first week of April, we will get back to full capacity,\" said Biswas, CEO, GC Apparels and Smartfactory4u, through a Skype interview from Shanghai.",
            "However, with COVID-19 creating dire situations in countries such as the U.S., Singapore, Italy and other European countries  all major export destinations for Chinese goods  Biswas is concerned that Chinese manufacturers, who are already struggling from the weeks-long disruption in production, may face a \"double impact.\"",
            "Related story: China focuses on road to recovery",
            "\"So earlier we were struggling due to internal situation like not getting people back to work. Now that the matter is coming under control, we may still face a decline in orders, especially from countries like the U.S., Italy and other EU nations because the situation has become worse there,\" he remarked.",
            "The Indian entrepreneur, who has lived in China for over 13 years, meanwhile praised the \"huge amount of support coming from the government\" to help companies through this challenging phase",
            "\"The Chinese government has offered several relaxations. They have given an extended interval of three months for firms to pay up their Social Security expenses. The medical insurance cost has been reduced. And the government has encouraged firms burdened with a large number of employees to get into flexible payment and salaries. These measures are definitely going to help the employers,\" he said.",

            "Factory operators also face the additional challenge of creating a sanitized work environment to prevent any further infection. Following government instructions, factories are providing face masks and disinfectants while also checking employees for any telltale symptom of the virus.",

So, all the workers are getting masks from the management. There are sanitizers at the entrance. Their temperature is routinely checked,\" he said.",

The customer needs certain products on certain time. If they miss that, they miss the sale. So, we are trying to reduce this fashion cycle, which currently has a 90-days lead time [for delivery of products], and compress it to 45 days,\" he elaborated.",

            "Biswas emphasized that the manufacturing capacity that China has developed over the years and the one that has given it the moniker of the \"World's Factory\" could not be easily replicated elsewhere. Therefore, it is simply a matter of time before things improve through a postponed consumption.",
            "\"Not a single of our clients have cancelled any orders. They acknowledge the difficult situation. So, we believe that whatever we are losing right now due to a manufacturing halt, we will make up for it in six months. It's going to be a better situation after six months,\" he said with optimism",
            "\"As things go back to normal, the orders will come pouring in to China, because the kind of raw material sources or the number of factories or the capacity China has, it's very difficult to get outside of China,\" he added.",
            "Biswas also insisted that this period of disruption has already made the Chinese factories \"hungry for business\" and therefore result in a dramatic escalation in production time.",
            "\"They will be definitely be more aggressive on getting orders on manufacturing. Probably the lead time, that is already compressed to 45 days, might get improved to 30 days. And if that happens, hardly anybody in the world can compete with China,\" he said.",

            "\"People are not inclined to spend much on luxury products right now. Many Chinese people used to buy branded luxury products from Europe and the U.S., that has certainly reduced. And with Italy under lockdown, the luxury sector is going to see a big downturn,\" he elucidated pointing out that Italy alone has a luxury market of over 100 billion U.S. dollars.",

And how are ordinary Chinese, many of whom are in self-isolation, surviving this epidemic? CGTN's Wang Guan takes a closer look.",
            "Locking down Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak and also a city of 11 million people, was a tough decision  and a controversial one. There were criticisms and concerns about human rights violations. \"The Chinese government can lock millions of people into cities with almost no advance notice should not be considered anything other than terrifying,\" said an article published in the Guardian.",

Now, 96 percent of the deaths and 80 percent of infections are in Hubei. Fewer than one percent of the infections and only two deaths are outside the Chinese mainland (as of February 12).The worst is not over yet, but data shows that the coronavirus is not a global pandemic yet. And people are seeing China's efforts in a different light.",

            "Dr. Gauden Galea, representative of the World Health Organization (WHO), also emphasized that carrying out social distancing, which means reducing as much as possible the number of contacts between people, is an extremely promising way of controlling and breaking the transmission.",
            "Another move generating discussion and debate is China's capacity to mobilize resources. Tens of thousands of medical staff were pooled from every Chinese region to help Hubei. Dozens of military aircraft and thousands of military personnel including doctors and nurses were sent in. And the country took only 10 days to build a new hospital.",
            "At the end of the day, it's about people. Emotionally, it has been a tough few weeks for more than one billion Chinese, most of whom have had to isolate themselves at home to avoid the virus. But as many of them showed, there is more than one way to stay sane and healthy.",

The focus now is on coronavirus. The information is combed through, analyzed and shared with member states. The operations room of ERCC has large monitors running the length of one wall. While each one shows a different set of data, information on coronavirus dominates. There are maps of the outbreak, showing the location, number of confirmed cases and death toll. At desks, half a dozen workers are poring over data. EU member states including France are among those that have sought financial and logistical assistance from Brussels to bring back its citizens from Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus outbreak began.Currently, there are around 600 EU citizens wanting to leave China.The ERCC is the heart of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which coordinates the delivery of assistance to disaster-stricken countries. Officials are working with Chinese authorities. Once that comes through, the first step in what will be a long process, can begin. Johannes Luchner, director of rescEU, an EU program for disaster response, told CGTN that the first job is to identify EU citizens who are seeking help to return home. \"The most important thing for us is to make sure that when the operation starts and there are no hiccups,\" he said.\"They get screened in Wuhan, then they go on the flight,\" said Luchner. \"They get quarantined when they arrive in the European Union. That is one of the details under discussion, will they all go to the same location, can some of them be repatriated immediately? But it's clear  everyone will have to be quarantined for 14 days.\"As the virus spreads, the nature of ERCC's work is adapting. Finland has confirmed its first case of coronavirus. A Chinese traveler from Wuhan is now in isolation in Lapland's central hospital. Officials now worry 15 more people may have been exposed. The Finnish case brings the total in Europe to nine, prompting ERCC and other bodies to step up efforts to stop the virus before it spreads across the continent.\"Arrangements were in place to ensure all member states had access to laboratory diagnosis, had issued guidelines to travelers and are preparing health systems,\" said Stella Kyriakides, European health commissioner. \"The member states continue to provide detailed information of their plans.Officials say Europe is well prepared and if the situation deteriorates, they have more levers to pull, including financial support for the development of a vaccine.

            "The world is watching how China is handling COVID-19. The experience with the coronavirus demonstrates to the world the level of mastery of that Chinese government and corporations attained with emerging technologies.",
            "The world has for some time been impressed not only with the adoption of emerging technologies in China by consumers, but also the power of Chinese corporations (from giants like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and many startups) in developing these technologies as well as the role of the Chinese government in driving the technology ecosystem. Now, China has put these technologies into the service of humanity.",
            "The first big success has been using AI and advanced computing to sequence the coronavirus in order to enable production of potential vaccines. For Chinese scientists, it took only one month to sequence the DNA. The pace of this development is recognized and applauded by scientists around the world.",
            "This success has only been possible by full and collaborative deployment in terms of capacity of Chinese technology companies. For example, Baidu has opened up its RNA prediction algorithm to global researchers. Other Chinese tech companies and research labs collaborated to open their computing resources for use against the coronavirus. Most of the scientific researches on coronavirus is available on the internet, as opposed to the siloed, limited access approach of the international scientific community took towards research during the Ebola outbreak.",
            "The existing technology infrastructure also helped tremendously in containing the coronavirus. At a time of Spring Festival when billions trips were made around the country, China's electronic ID system enables the authorities to track people from the regions where the virus originates and keep the people they contacted safe. A very limited number of countries in the world enjoy such an advanced electronic ID system. Imagine how the world would tackle epidemics if there was a global digital ID system.",
            "The most revolutionary impact is probably in the area of remote working. Amid the restrictions imposed after the lunar New Year, many people started their work remotely, thanks to China's strong internet infrastructure and ubiquity of mobile access. Adding to this, school classes are now online. The advanced online infrastructure and abundance of innovative startups in China in areas, such as online food delivery, are playing a key role in sustaining remote work and study during the epidemic.",
            "We probably all heard about theater plays, in which the actor playing the main character falls sick one day, and the costume designer who already memorized the play fills in, actually having a better performance and staying in the cast. As the dust settles after the coronavirus, it will not be surprising if many people discover that they overuse offices and schools, and we can actually save time and carbon footprint by doing a lot of work remotely. China could be a trend-setter in this area.A popular idiom in Turkish is \"Every cloud has a silver lining.\" While the world admires how China tackles the coronavirus, there is also a lot to learn from the practical use of technology that China demonstrates. The level of collaborative research, the level of innovation in infrastructure technologies and, most importantly, the flexibility, adaptability, and agility to apply these technologies in case of an emergency are key pillars of China's response to the coronavirus epidemic.",
            "China was able to respond effectively thanks to its historical eagerness to develop and adopt new technologies, the cohesion of its society and its strong leadership.",

            "Off-label prescription refers to the use of a drug in different terms than the ones established in the marketing authorization (MA), that is, the approval issued by the competent drug authority - in China's case, the National Medical Products Administration. The MA allows the launching of a new drug into the market after a strict assessment of several materials (studies, results of clinical trials) presented by the drug manufacturer. No drug can be merchandised before having an MA, which settles the proper conditions to use the drug.",
            "However, all around the world, drugs are systematically being prescribed outside the conditions of the respective MA. They are used for different types of patients (for instance, for children, when the drugs was only approved for adults), in a different method of administration (instead of an intravenous infusion, the drug is used in the form of eye drops), with a different dosage (2 ml per days instead of the approved 1 ml per day), or for a different medical condition (even though the drug was approved for hypertension, it is now being used for migraine headaches).",
            "Off-label prescription is not necessarily illegal. Actually, it might even be required to meet the best standard of care in certain situations, such as when there is no drug specifically approved for the medical condition or when the duly approved drug is not effective any more for a given patient.",
            "Nonetheless, it remains as a particularly risky practice. When we use a drug that was not specifically approved for that particular use (that is, when we use it off-label), we lack proper scientific evidences regarding the safety and efficiency of that use, which increases the risks of adverse drug effects and severe injuries for the patients. Moreover, off-label use frequently requires the manipulation of the drug (repacking the drug, solving it in a liquid, etc.), which increases the risks of contamination, even when performed in a sterile environment.",
            "Therefore, though this practice should be accepted as good medical practice, it is imperative to have a regulation establishing the conditions for its legitimacy. But that hardly happens, and most countries lack a proper legal framework for off-label prescription. This question is particularly relevant nowadays because off-label drug use tends to increase during epidemics. Many epidemics involve new viruses, for which we do not have authorized drugs. Off-label drug use arises as a promising hope to cope with dramatic public health problems. For instance, during the SARS crisis, antibiotics were prescribed above the regular approved dosage (i.e., off-label) in order to manage the growing health crisis.",
            "To counter the COVID-19 outbreak, off-label drug use emerges again as a valuable resource. The guidelines developed by Chinese experts, in accordance with the general rules of WHO Guideline Development and the WHO Rapid Advice Guideline, recommend that infected patients are to be treated with the drug Kaletra (a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir), originally approved for HIV. Very recently, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology announced that Chloroquine Phosphate, a drug approved for the treatment of malaria, was found to have curative effects on the novel coronavirus disease. Several other drugs are being suggested as therapeutic options, all within off-label drug use, combined with traditional Chinese medicine and experimental drugs.",
            "Like the legal framework in many other jurisdictions, China still has some work to do in this field. And there are still doubts about the admissibility of off-label prescription under the current Chinese law. It is imperative to clarify whether off-label prescription is in accordance with the law, when can it be used, if and when can off-label drug use renders doctors accountable (medical liability), and under which conditions can pharmaceutical companies release information about off-label use of their drugs.",
            "Epidemics present a challenge for everyone, doctors, scientists, governments, security forces, the community in general. Lawmakers are challenged to create laws adequate to these difficult times. Off-label drug use is one of the topics that requires legal attention.",

            "Experts have pointed out that the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a self-limited disease, which refers to some special virus infections and autoimmune diseases that can be cured through one's own immune regulation, such as a viral cold.",
            "But, it's wrong to equate COVID-19 with a disease that doesn't require treatment, said Wang Guiqiang, chief physician at Peking University First Hospital.",
            "\"Self-limited disease is an expression shared by infectious diseases and some other diseases, which means that no special intervention or etiological treatment is required, and eventually the patient can recover by him/herself,\" said Wang. \"But self-healing is not the same as no need for treatment.\"",
            "From the perspective of virology, the novel coronavirus doesn't need intensive antiviral treatment. Some patients can effectively eliminate the virus through their own strong immunity and the disease will not turn into a chronic one, said Wang, adding that some mild cases can be cured by general supportive symptomatic treatment and traditional Chinese medicine.",
            "But the disease does result in some deaths. For the elderly with underlying diseases, in particular, COVID-19 can cause complications which worsen their conditions and lead to death.",
            "\"Mild cases should not be taken lightly either,\" stressed Wang, as the disease may progress rapidly.",
            "The novel coronavirus reproduces slowly in the human body in the early stage, making it less likely to alert the immune system. However, many patients deteriorated suddenly after a week or two, said Ding Xinmin, chief physician of the respiratory department at Beijing Shijitan Hospital.",
            "\"Patients differ in genes and immunity. People with low immunity are unable to resist the invasion of the virus, and an excessive immune response may set off a cytokine storm, causing greater damage,\" Ding explained.",
            "Wang emphasized the importance of timely treatment for patients of COVID-19. \"All patients should be diagnosed early and treated early to avoid the risk of developing into severe condition.\"",

            "After the Dow dropped by 3.6 percent, the third-biggest daily point drop in its history, and followed by another 3.3 percent decline the day after, the U.S. seems to be waking to the shock of COVID-19.",
            "One could say that the U.S. has been sufficiently warned. It has been more than a month since the initial outbreak in China. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, had made warnings to other governments about preparing for outbreaks within their borders. \"It's impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take,\" Dr. Tedros said on February 15, adding that \"the steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought the world time.\"",
            "But the U.S. seems to be caught off guard, and the response has been chaotic.",
            "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been clear that America is expecting COVID-19 to spread at the community level and \"disruption to everyday life may be severe.\" The statement was later to be contradicted by White House Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow's assertion that the U.S. has contained the coronavirus.",
            "Appearing before a Senate hearing on Tuesday, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf was apparently too under-informed to give a straight answer to senator's questioning. When asked by Republican Senator John Kennedy about the estimated number of cases in the U.S., the best answer Wolf came up with was \"we do anticipate the number will grow.\" After a couple of attempts to get some of the most basic questions answered by the secretary, Senator Kennedy was so exasperated that he had all but called the cabinet official of his own political party failing at the job.",
            "Harkening back to U.S.' evacuation of Diamond Princess where officials didn't report to the president about transporting healthy and infected personnel on the same plane, defying CDC's advice, the pattern seems to be emerging. Technical experts are ignored while politicians with executive authorities are failing to grasp at the severity of the situation.",

            "Since Iran announced its first patient of COVID-19 two weeks ago, the number of both fatality and confirmed cases in this country has been surging. Iran has so far reported 3,513 cases of COVID-19 and 107 deaths as of Thursday. It has temporarily shut schools, universities and other educational institutions, and cancelled all public events.",
            "But the political vortex around Iran never stops. On Thursday Tehran again denied U.N. nuclear inspectors access to sites where they have claimed finding of uranium traces, arguing that the agency's case is based on \"fabricated\" Israeli intelligence.",
            "It appears the same case with Iraq. On Thursday, three Katyusha rockets were fired towards the heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses the U.S. embassy and other missions, in the Iraqi capital, police sources said. The Green Zone, which also houses government buildings, has been repeatedly hit by rockets for months.",
            "Meanwhile, Iraq's health ministry has announced its first two confirmed deaths related to the new coronavirus disease, according to the BBC, but the source has not been confirmed by the Iraqi government. Iraq has so far reported 38 cases of COVID-19, most of them linked to neighboring Iran.",
            "COVID-19 spreading among Iran's elite",
            "On Thursday, another prominent figure tested positive for novel coronavirus in Iran, the country's Vice President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar, according to Iranian media. In addition, the head of the national security and policy committee of the Iranian parliament, Mojtaba Zolnour, also announced on Thursday that he too had contracted the virus.",
            "Zolnour is from Qom, one of Shia Islam's two holiest cities and the epicenter of the virus in Iran. Earlier this week, another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, tested positive for coronavirus.",
            "The virus seems to be spreading quickly among Iran's elite.On Thursday alone, the country reported five more prominent members testing positive for coronavirus. This comes after two senior Iranian officials have already died from the virus and several more are infected. According to the semiofficial ILNA news agency, the head of Iran's emergency medical services, Pirhossein Kolivand, has been infected as well. Just the day before, he gave a press conference, claiming Iran had the coronavirus under control.",
            "Iran is now the main center of contamination and exporter of the coronavirus outside China. The U.S. president Trump's continuation of the isolation policy as Iran grapples with the coronavirus epidemic crisis may possibly backfire not only the U.S. but the rest of the world.",
            "China on Thursday called for the immediate lifting of the sanctions against Iran given the severe outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. The ongoing sanctions from Washington have made Tehran more skittish about taking any public health measure, such as reducing contacts with trading partners or declaring a public health emergency, that could further damage its already ailing economy.",

            "\"Business has stopped. We haven't had one single visitor since around six months, maybe some five Iraqis came but no foreigner,\" a hotel owner in Najaf, one of the hottest destinations for pilgrims in Iraq, told Reuters. \"Unemployment has jumped (in Najaf).\"",
            "More than ten million arrived annually alone in Najaf, half of them Iranians. With the coronavirus spreading, authorities have banned foreign pilgrims, paralyzing an industry already crippled by anti-government protests. In total about 4,000 people working in the hospitality sector have lost their jobs in Najaf alone, said Saib Radhi Abu Ghanem, head of the local hotel and restaurant association.",
            "Tourism is a key industry not just in Najaf but also in Kerbela, Baghdad and Samarra, home to other Shia places of worshiping. More unemployment could fuel the protests, which are driven by complaints by many Iraqis about corruption, mismanagement and the lack of basic services despite Iraq's oil wealth.",
            "The crisis is worsened by a domestic political void in Iraq that leaves the seat of the country's top leader vacant for over three months. Caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who quit in November over a deadly protest, walked away from his duty again on Monday, a day after his designated successor, Mohammed Allawi withdrew his candidacy after heavily divided lawmakers failed to approve a Cabinet of his designated successor.",

            "On the same day, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, in a paper named the virus SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2.",
            "While the WHO is responsible for naming new diseases, the CSG follows a scientific procedure in naming new viruses.",

            "Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said the coronavirus epidemic is a major public health emergency with the fastest spread, the widest range of infections, and the most difficult prevention and control in China since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.",
            "The situation is showing a positive trend after arduous efforts, but it is still grim and complex. It is now the most crucial moment to curb the spread, Xi told hundreds of thousands of officials from the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee level to county level as well as military officials of corresponding levels via videoconference.",
            "The two-hour meeting aimed to advance the work on coordinating the prevention and control of the COVID-19 and economic and social development.",
            "The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up and rising up from the hardships, Xi said.",

            "Xi said since the start of the outbreak, the CPC Central Committee has attached great importance to the issue, made swift deployment, strengthened the centralized, unified leadership of the Party, requiring Party committees and governments at all levels to put people's lives and health as the top priority and adopt effective measures to curb the spread of the virus.",
            "The CPC Central Committee has made it a prominent task to improve the admission and cure rates and reduce the infection and mortality rates, Xi said, noting that Wuhan and Hubei have been taken as the country's main battlefield against the epidemic.",
            "Efforts have also been made to strengthen the emergency supply of medical materials and daily necessities, safeguard social stability and win the support of the international community, he added.",

            "Second, the epidemic prevention and control work in Beijing should be carried out with all-out efforts. Both imported cases and spread within the capital city should be prevented;",
            "Third, medical resources and key supplies should be allocated in a scientific manner, providing more protection for the medical workers;",
            "Fourth, scientific research should be accelerated in terms of drug and vaccine development. Effective diagnosis and treatment plans should be summarized and promoted in time;",
            "Fifth, international and regional cooperation should be expanded. Good communication with the World Health Organization and experience sharing with relevant countries should be continued;",
            "Sixth, public communication through news media should be more effective. Release of the information of the epidemic should be improved;",
            "Seventh, social stability should be well safeguarded. Illegal activities disturbing medical treatment, epidemic prevention, and market and social order should be severely punished.",
            "Economic impact manageable",
            "The impact of the epidemic on China's economic and social development is temporary and generally manageable, Xi noted.",
            "He said the COVID-19 epidemic will inevitably deal a relatively big blow to China's economic and social development. However, at such a time it is even more important to view China's development in a comprehensive, dialectical and long-term perspective, and to strengthen and firm up confidence.",
            "In general, the fundamentals of China's long-term sound economic growth remain unchanged, he said.",
            "Orderly resumption of work, production",
            "Stressing orderly resumption of work and production, Xi made specific requirements to that end.",
            "Each region should adopt a precise approach when advancing resumption of work and production based on local health risks, Xi said.",
            "Regions with relatively low risks should reorient their disease prevention and control strategies as soon as possible to focus on forestalling imported cases and comprehensively restoring the order of production and life, Xi said.",
            "Medium-risk regions should promote work and production resumption in an orderly manner based on local epidemic-control situations, while high-risk regions should continue to be fully committed to doing a good job in epidemic prevention and control, he said.",
            "Xi stressed strengthening the regulation role of macro-economic policies, calling for more positivity in the country's proactive fiscal policy and the roll-out of more targeted interim policies in cutting taxes and fees to help micro, small and medium-sized firms tide over difficulties.",
            "Besides, the prudent monetary policy should feature more flexibility and moderation, Xi said, calling for making good use of existing financial support policies and introducing new policies and measures in due course.",
            "China will step up efforts to keep employment stable, with all-round measures to cut corporate burdens, keep the payroll stable, and create more jobs, Xi said, adding that in addressing the outstanding problems of serious scarcity of workers in some enterprises, high pressure in keeping the payroll stable, and difficulty of key groups to obtain employment, efforts should be given to support flexible employment through multiple channels and facilitate employment of college graduates.",
            "The country should resolutely accomplish the task of alleviating poverty despite the impact of the epidemic, Xi said, urging efforts to help poor workers return to their posts in an orderly manner, support leading poverty alleviation enterprises and workshops to resume work as soon as possible, and improve mechanisms to prevent people from returning to poverty.",
            "Xi underscored efforts to push for the resumption of work and production with precise epidemic prevention and control strategies, while smoothing travels and logistics channels and lifting cargo transport bans to push all links in the industrial chains to resume work and production in a coordinated way.",
            "The country should actively expand effective domestic demand, fast-track the progress of projects under construction and new ones, as well as enhance guarantees for labor, land, funds and other production factors.",
            "In the meantime, China will ensure the timely agriculture work in spring, Xi said.",
            "In doing so, he urged efforts to address the protruding issues in spring farming preparation and ensure well-organized production, transportation and supply of farming materials.",
            "Xi also noted that people's basic livelihood should be guaranteed, such as the supply of staple and non-staple food. Enhanced efforts should be made to take care of those in need as well as those losing their family members due to the epidemic. Efforts should also be made to coordinate medical treatment for patients with other diseases.",
            "The country should keep the foreign trade and investment stable amid the epidemic outbreak, Xi stressed.",
            "Foreign trade policy tools like export tax rebates and export credit insurances should be put to good and full play to ensure smooth operation of foreign trade industrial chains and supply chains.",
            "Major foreign investment projects should be well implemented, while opening-up of finance and other services should be expanded. Business environment should continue to be optimized to strengthen foreign businesses' confidence in long-term investment and operation in China, Xi said.",
            "In order to win the people's war against the epidemic, the Party's leadership should be strengthened, Xi said.",
            "Xi required cadres at all levels, especially the leading officials, to take initiative in fulfilling duties.",
            "Cadres who make outstanding contributions should be awarded, while those who fail to perform their duties should be held accountable, Xi noted.",
            "Stressing more care for primary-level cadres, Xi called for solving their practical difficulties in a timely manner and resolutely rectifying the practice of formalities for formalities' sake and bureaucratism.",

Worse, some of this misinformation has triggered xenophobic attacks and abuse on Chinese people and those with Asian features.",

            "Beyond human habits in winter months, a large number of respiratory infections, including COVID-19, are passed through droplets produced when people cough and sneeze.

            "You might have come across this term a lot recently: nucleic acid test. As one can tell from the name, it is about testing the presence of the virus's genetic material, the RNA or DNA.",

            "We know that the genetic material of the new coronavirus is RNA. But most of our tools for this test are specific to DNA. So scientists need to take virus's RNA as a template, create a complementary strand and make a DNA copy of it. This process is called \"reverse transcription.\" Transcription is the copying of DNA into RNA, and here the process is reversed.",
            "Now we have a mess of DNA fragments from everything in this sample: patients' own cells, harmless bacteria and so on. How do we find the coronavirus?",
            "Scientists in China sequenced the virus's genome and made it available to the world on January 10. This means, we know the entire RNA sequence of the new coronavirus. It allows us to compare it with other virus strains in this family and find what's unique  in other words, its distinctive signature.",
            "If this signature can be found in the sample, it means the virus exists. But how is this done? Scientists copy small pieces from this distinctive fragment of DNA, what they called \"primers.\" They then heat up a sample to separate the strands of all DNA inside. If there are any traces of the new coronavirus, the primer will grab onto it and start to make copies. One DNA becomes two, two becomes four, until there are billions of copies. To make the process easier to observe, scientists add fluorescent labels to the primers, meaning the more viral bits there are, the brighter it glows, telling scientists that virus exists.",
            "One problem is the test can have minor errors. Primers can grab onto a piece of DNA in the wrong way or be led astray by contamination from a previous sample or the throat swab may not contain enough virus. All these could lead to a wrong result. Chinese scientists say in practice, just 30-50 percent of infected patients test positive.",
            "On top of this, testing for the highly infectious coronavirus needs to be undertaken in a lab with high bio-safety levels, usually within a country's disease control authority. There are four levels and only labs with protection levels 3 and 4 are allowed to test such virus. That's why testing has been relatively slow, especially during the outbreak.",

            "To understand how China is battling COVID-19 and its consequences, one needs to follow the money.",
            "By the latest count, in addition to yuan loans worth 113 billion U.S. dollars granted by financial institutions and more than 70 billion U.S. dollars paid out by insurance companies, the Chinese government has allocated about 13 billion U.S. dollars to counter fallout from the outbreak.",
            "The numbers could look abstract. However, breaking the data down reveals how the money is being carefully targeted. The government is allocating the money based on a thorough evaluation of the system's strengths.",
            "The central government has supplied an equivalent about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars. Nearly one-fifth of the amount has been channeled to the epicenter of the outbreak  central Hubei Province  in an oversight over the core health problem.",
            "Local governments are equipped with more local knowledge that allows them to surgically support key manufacturers or producers that are struggling.",
            "Together, they have borne the bulk of the financial responsibility with an allocation of equivalently more than nine billion U.S. dollars. It is carefully targeted, divided into hundreds of thousands of individual grants that are tailor-made by and for each county, town, city and business.",
            "Take eastern Zhejiang Province as an example. Yongjia County, a county of roughly 800,000 people in the southeast of the province, has a sizable agricultural sector.",
            "Due to the virus outbreak, the county government has raised the subsidy rate for equipment used in tea production from 30 percent to 50 percent with an investment of an equivalent of roughly 60,000 U.S. dollars.",
            "In Huzhou City, farmers who harvest fast-growing vegetables in greenhouses with more than 3,000 square meters of plantation area will receive a one-time subsidy equal to around 43 U.S. dollars per 600 square meters to boost production.",
            "In the neighboring Jiangsu Province, similar policies have been in lace as well. A sum worth more than seven million U.S. dollars was allocated to Nanjing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd for emergency production of protective gear and other medical supplies.",
            "But, just tracking the allocated cash isn't enough. The government is also providing financial support to companies in core industries through policy.",
            "As businesses are forced to suspend operations for months, some critical firms have become cash poor and driven to the brink of insolvency. The central government released a set of policies to cut taxes and other measures to sustain these companies.",
            "One natural gas company in Yunnan Province was able to get a tax cut worth roughly about 900,000 U.S. dollars just two hours after applying, reported Xinhua.",
            "For those that are essential to combating the virus, the government is also granting exemptions and deductions to help boost production.",
            "A biotech company in Shanghai has a daily production of 50 tons of disinfectant. Under the new policy, it would be able to invest an amount worth more than 700,000 U.S. dollars in enlarging production capability and a tax deduction nearly worth 86,000 U.S. dollars.",
            "Some used to believe that whenever China faces a problem, it just pumps money into the system to solve it. But, the money flow over the course of the past several months shows that the governments  both the central and local ones  are tapping into the system's strengths.",
            "With the central government focused on directly combating the health issues, the local governments have been able to use their financial resources to stem the economic impact of the virus.",
            "The all-of-government approach has been able to mitigate COVID-19's negative consequences, thereby buying the world time to make the necessary health and economic preparations for outbreaks beyond China's borders. And the money allocated is the tip of the spear in this global fight against the disease.",

            "When vice chairman of Kissinger Associates Joshua Cooper Ramo wrote in his op-ed that the coronavirus is a test not just for China but the whole new, connected world, he became the latest outsider to justify China's effort in fighting the disease outbreak. Over the past month, global sentiments toward China and its government at all levels have been delicately changing from being offensive and denunciatory to one of empathy and concern.",
            "From the tagline \"coronavirus Made in China\" on the cover of a Der Spiegel issue to the headline \"Sinophobia won't save you from the coronavirus\" on Al Jazeera, from French tabloid Le Courier Picard's \"Alerte jaune\" (Yellow alert) to strangers hugging a girl holding a placard reading \"Hug me! I'm not a virus,\" rationality in the global media discourse is emerging out of the nationalism, racism, politicization and xenophobia that have come about from the panic caused by the constant reports on the coronavirus in this super-connected world. As time goes by, we are also seeing the best in people in the worst of times.",
            "These past two weeks have been a masterclass in on-the-ground reporting. Since the coronavirus outbreak caused mass paralysis in cities throughout China, several of my colleagues have been reporting in Wuhan  the epicenter of the outbreak  while I stayed in Beijing interviewing people who have to soldier on despite their fear and self-doubt in order to keep the megacity running. Moving around the Chinese capital has not been easy, not only because of the limited number of taxi and DiDi drivers left during the extended Spring Festival holiday, but also due to the bone-chilling winds and snowfall plaguing the waning days of winter.",
            "Even with the eerie calm that has descended on the usually bustling Chinese capital  with many cloistered in their homes for fear of catching the coronavirus  some are still out and about because the show must go on. From the deliveryman who has to serve over 80 households each day to the auntie who continues to screen residents who may have the infection even after breaking her arm, there is a sense of community in trying to persevere in the face of adversity.",
            "The media focus has understandably been on the number of people who have been infected by the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), where it's spreading to, and the amount of new confirmed and suspected cases. More striking are the reports of Chinese and other people of Asian descent who are suffering from discrimination  both subtle and blatant  because of deep-seated xenophobia and historical biases.",
            "From schools to the workplace to even restaurants in ubiquitous Chinatowns the world over, there is the notion that this virus is a \"Chinese disease\" in the ugliest sense of the term. Chinese and other Asians are considered by some people to be unclean, with social media posts and videos lambasting the people for their culinary tastes and sense of hygiene.",
            "Despite these disheartening instances, there have been more consequential acts demonstrating that we are ultimately a global community. Japanese organizations have held fundraising campaigns to get money and equipment to medical personnel in areas hit hard by the coronavirus, including the ground zero city of Wuhan. The Japanese Education Ministry even urged parents to teach their children not to discriminate against their Chinese peers. Americans are donating masks and other much-needed medical supplies to Chinese organizations, cleaning out the stocks of large U.S. retailers such as Walmart and Home Depot. Overseas Chinese are raising money en masse through online campaigns and through local cultural organizations so that their brethren in China can tackle this crisis.",
            "Along with the inspiring acts come reassuring changes in tones of global media coverage, like the commentary by Ramo in the Los Angeles Times. He called on more people to be aware of the perils of the panic spreading faster than ever in this connected age. There's no denying that for a month now, it's been more of a panic epidemic than a disease epidemic given the deluge of conflicting information. In a conversation published a few days ago, Alex Traub of the New York Times talked to the publication's science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. who's covered SARS, MERS, the H5N1 bird flu, Zika... and now the coronavirus. He calls for the need to spread truth instead of panic during reporting. In this fight against the disease outbreak, we are seeing how our journalism is progressing from scorn and criticism to empathy and humanity.",

            "During the time of fear and uncertainty, the helping hands who selflessly put their lives on the line, the reporting of different narratives, and regular people trying to go about their daily lives are an encouraging reminder that we are all in this together. Labeling the novel coronavirus a \"Chinese disease\" or singling out those of Chinese descent is counterproductive in containing its spread and treating infected individuals.",
            "There should not be an \"us vs. them\" mentality in a world that is connected, not only economically, but through personal and professional ties that transcend national borders. Fear of the unknown is understandable but should not be used to justify acts of discrimination. Empathy at times like this is difficult to muster  but doing the right thing has never been easy.",

            "The other is action. \"If you settle down, roll up your sleeves and begin that systematic work of case finding and contact tracing, you definitely can change the shape of the outbreak, take the heat out of it, and prevent a lot of people from getting sick and a lot of the most vulnerable from dying.\"",
            "It's normal to see criticism emerging in societies, especially during an epidemic outbreak. But if such mishaps don't reflect the general picture, why are they being highlighted? Remember the ancient fable about the blind men and the elephant? The six men quarrel about the animal's overall appearance because they are only touching one part of its body and imagine it to be the whole.",
            "But here we have more than just mistakes, they smear China by exaggerating negative incidents and turning opinions to facts. Are they being honest with facts? Partially true, but deliberately off-balance.",
            "That's an old trick, following a stereotypical pattern  first, eye-catching headlines with words like \"government censorship\" or \"propaganda machine.\" Then find complaints on social media. Finally, piece them all together. If you are a long-term subscriber of such media, now you see a China with no hope as \"public cynicism running high\" and Beijing facing the \"biggest challenge to its legitimacy in decades.\" That's how the Wall Street Journal misdiagnosed China as the \"Real Sick Man of Asia.\"",
            "But is the situation in China going from bad to worse? Well, Morgan Stanley has just picked China, Singapore and Australia stocks as virus shelters. Are they being silly?",

            "Empty restaurants, silent roads: For many living and working in Beijing including myself, the rise of the novel coronavirus epidemic that has killed over 2,700 people in recent weeks has meant an unprecedented interruption to the fast-paced rhythm of life in China's capital city.",
            "This week, life in Beijing has been quietly stirring, after the swift top-down implementation last month of measures to stop the spread of the disease changed everything in just a few days.",
            "No customers allowed",
            "The most noticeable change has been the extent to which shops, bars, restaurants and other establishments have closed.",
            "Beijing is filled with a seemingly infinite number of cheap food outlets, but many have shut their doors  voluntarily or otherwise  in order to prevent coronavirus' spread. Gui Jie, a long, typically buzzing street in my central neighborhood, is flanked on both sides by a string of brightly lit restaurants, many of which are so popular that patient diners often sit on stools on the pavement outside to wait for a table. These restaurants are now unsettlingly dark, each bearing a notice explaining why it is closed for business.",
            "The Chinese entrepreneurial spirit remains, however. I've walked past restaurants selling raw ingredients in their entrance ways, all the while being closed to dine-in customers.",
            "Ordering food via a delivery service such as Tencent-backed Mei Tuan, whose yellow-liveried drivers and electric delivery bikes are ubiquitous in Beijing, has been trickier due to restaurant closures. Nonetheless, some establishments have embraced the lifestyle change of their staff and customers. One favorite now includes a free surgical mask inside each of its takeaway bags, a hygiene-conscious interpretation of a McDonald's Happy Meal gift. Another is handing out red rubber bracelets emblazoned with the slogan \"China  be strong!\" with its deliveries.",
            "Beijing's small business owners have also made innovative use of the mobile payment technologies that dominate and facilitate life in the city. I've noticed a number of convenience stores implement no-contact shopping. Front doors are held open just a crack, or else shopkeepers have barricaded themselves in with stock. Customers call out for what they want and an arm appears from inside to give them their goods  alternatively, they help themselves  and pay by scanning a QR code by the door on their smartphone.",
            "In arguably another common-sense attempt to limit human contact, I've taken DiDis (China's version of Uber) in which a clear plastic sheet has been put up between the front and back seats to help prevent the driver from getting sick.",
            "Often I can barely see people's faces anyway. Beijing's bitterly cold winter, and the additional threat posed by coronavirus, have meant that everyone has been doubly bundled up to protect against both freezing temperatures and infection. Plastic goggles and visors have been worn by some. Personally, I dislike wearing my mask when speaking to others, for example at work, as I think that it impacts my ability to communicate.",
            "Finding consolation",
            "Quarantine measures have meant that much of Beijing's workforce has been housebound. For me, this has led to increased neighborliness. During a day spent working from home, I typically hear the regular pings of WeChat browser notifications through one wall from the neighbor to my left; while simultaneously listening to the English teacher who lives to my right through the other, animatedly reading a story as he teaches online.",
            "We've all seen more of each other, and socialized more, since the Spring Festival holiday in January when novel coronavirus prevention measures first kicked in. I've found the camaraderie of us all making do, living in a row and working from home, reassuring.",
            "This is useful given that everyone I've spoken to has been living with background health anxiety. I'm no different. A cough, not uncommon if Beijing's air quality is poor, makes everyone worry. We are all hyper-aware of anything mildly unusual in terms of our physical health, even if it has nothing to do with the virus' known symptoms. While this is irrational, I recently watched a team of paramedics in hazmat suits carrying a stretcher down my street: Triggers are easy to find.",
            "A different kind of data collection",
            "The street I live on, one of Beijing's traditional, single-story hutongs, has been barricaded at every entrance. Community workers at each gate check the temperature of anyone who wants to enter. In a community center nearby, I registered my details to receive a card proving that I am a local resident, and so can access the area without having to write my name, address, phone number and temperature on a form every time I want to get to my home.",
            "Enthusiasm for temperature checking has grown during the epidemic. In its first few days, these became routine at metro station entrances, while heat-sensitive cameras were installed by the turnstiles at my office. Now, my temperature is scanned at doorways of shopping malls as well as the individual shops inside. Cafes require a temperature check before I can order and I must write this, along with my name, phone number and time of entry, down on a form.",
            "Changes to everyday life",
            "Beijing's metro system is routinely heaving with people as expected in a city of over 20 million. \"All hours are peak hours,\" my mother declared when she last visited. But now I regularly have an entire row of seats to myself.",
            "Gyms have been closed for over a month. I've been trying to walk 10,000 steps a day, while some of my friends have newly downloaded workout apps to use at home. My Chinese teacher told me about a joke going around: Once the quarantine period is over, everyone will be several pounds heavier.",
            "Socializing also happens much less. Some friends have been afraid to leave home; \"I'm so bored,\" one messaged me via WeChat. Being among the few diners in a restaurant, part of which may be barricaded off with chairs, is the new normal. A group meal at a friend's house recently felt like a meeting of a secret enclave, though we were all desperate to let off some steam. I've also had speculative conversations as to whether or not there will be a post-coronavirus baby boom in nine months' time.",
            "The strangest part of the whole experience has been living without the mundane things that are a noticeable part of the fabric of daily life. I was impressed to see that one friend had gotten his hair cut, no mean feat given that until this week, all barbershops that I'd seen were closed. A friend in another country messaged me to apologize for being late to call one evening as she'd been stuck in a traffic jam  only for me to realize that I'd not seen one, normally ubiquitous in this city full of cars, for weeks.",

The views expressed in the video are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of CGTN.",
            "CGTN: What is your take on China's management of the current coronavirus outbreak?",
            "Dhanapala: I've been here since the outbreak of the crisis several weeks ago. And I've been very impressed by the overall management of the crisis by government but also by civil society and the public. If you are looking at government responses, the responses have been massive. Looking at the strengthening of surveillance and health care systems. For example, the building of hospitals within days, deployment of medical staff to Hubei Province, which is the epicenter.",
            "Of course, there's also been strong action to limit the spread of the virus. For example, the locking down of a city of 11 million people like Wuhan. This could be achieved in very few other countries. So that has been impressive. Also, the self-discipline of people who have been self-quarantining and self-isolating in order to stop the spread of the virus.",
            "There's also been a very good dissemination program, sharing of information on the latest developments, and really communicating clearly with the public on preventive actions and so on. This is very, very important in this kind of situation of a public health emergency.",
            "But, equally impressive has been what civil society and the public have been doing. We have been reading about volunteers who ferry medical staff to work. These people are working nonstop since the Spring Festival to ensure that medical supplies are provided to people on the front line in Wuhan City. We are also hearing about volunteers bringing food and essential supplies to the elderly and others who cannot actually go forward and get supplies for themselves. We are reading about overseas students and overseas Chinese sending supplies to China, and those who can't fly back are actually sending the supplies through well-meaning strangers embarking on flights to China. We've had reports of non-governmental organizations, NGOs, sending medical supplies to China  from Belarus, for example, from Japan, from Russia.",
            "And also, looking at the private sector, there are those who are putting their country and their people first. Chinese factories, for example, are delaying business deals, switching their production lines from their staple product to the products that are needed right now  for example, much-needed masks, protective gowns for domestic use and so on. And generally, companies and individuals are donating supplies and money to support the response. This is impressive.",
            "CGTN: Chinese people have faced discriminatory rhetoric and actions during the COVID-19 outbreak. How does this affect the response to the humanitarian crisis?",
            "Dhanapala: Let me say straight away, this is a time for solidarity, for international solidarity. It is not a time for stigma. For me, when we think about stigma, this is prejudice. And prejudice contributes to forming opinions based on little or no information, or misinformation. Misinformation and rumors create fear and anxiety, be it against refugees or those who are suspected of carrying the virus. Now, if we don't check this, if we don't course-correct, this leads to stigma, discrimination against certain groups of people. These people can wrongly be perceived to be troublemakers, but in reality they are innocent, vulnerable, need help, and are simply victims of circumstance. Stigma and discrimination can lead to the exclusion of people who really need help and empathy. It's important, really important, to focus on the facts, objective fact-based information, and to understand the challenges and find solutions together. We need international solidarity and cooperation to share information expertise. I was mentioning this earlier to pool resources where they are most needed and to make sure vulnerable people get the help that they need. So we really need to come together, as an international community, in fighting the stigma.",
            "CGTN: What would you like to say to inspire or cheer up China and Chinese people right now?",
            "Dhanapala: Firstly, our thoughts are very much with you as we weather this crisis together. We are inspired by your perseverance. The perseverance, the courage, the resilience of the Chinese people in the face of this crisis has been very impressive. We, as the international community, and we here with the UN stand in solidarity with you. Of course, the road ahead may be long and unknown, but we are confident that China can survive this crisis with hope and with optimism. .",

            "Fear is spreading that the COVID-19 outbreak is catalyzing a chain reaction of interconnected consequences across the world, but everything can still be contained if countries learn from China's experience in dealing with the virus' spread. Italy, Iran and South Korea are the new epicenters of this disease, causing alarm in Europe, the Middle East and East Asia, respectively, and making many wonder just how far-reaching the socio-economic and political impacts will be.",
            "There's already talk about restricting the free movement of people within the Schengen Zone after the outbreak in Northern Italy, the potential for more protests in Iran as a result of its border closures worsening its ongoing economic crisis, and the alternatives that technology companies have for replacing much-needed supplies from South Korean factories in the event that their production is disrupted if the virus spreads further. All of these are relevant questions, but the most important should be about coordinating a global response.",
            "Tens of millions of people in China have had to temporarily adjust their lifestyles in response to the government's proactive containment efforts, and the world can learn a lot from what the country has gone through over the past month. After all, the scale and scope of what's happening in China are large enough to be used as a model for other states to follow, and the successes that it's had thus far show the proper way to deal with this situation, provided that other authorities have the political will to do so.",
            "The centralized nature of the Chinese state has once again proven to be a strategic advantage. Instead of an ad hoc response hastily slapped together by local, state and national officials  all of whom might have self-interested partisan motivations for promoting one approach over another  the Communist Party of China was able to swiftly implement an effective policy that gradually expanded until it eventually got ahead of the virus' geographic spread and served to thwart further outbreaks.",
            "Other countries have different political systems, but they can still learn from China's experience. For example, concerned citizens can volunteer to assist their local governments and police forces in screening fellow residents of their apartment blocks or neighborhoods for symptoms of the virus. The political canvassers popular in Western countries already specialize in community outreach efforts, so they could potentially serve as the vanguard of these efforts, provided that they have the authorities' permission and coordinate with them.",
            "Local governments can request the assistance of nearby military forces to ensure the reliable transit and distribution of foodstuffs within the affected areas, with those aforesaid forces carrying out their activities as part of a larger statewide or nationwide policy. Speaking of which, higher-level authorities would naturally be responsible for temporarily restricting the movement of people throughout certain parts of the country, with it also being wise to conduct health screenings at transportation hubs to identify those who display symptoms.",
            "Regular news updates from trusted sources are also a very important component of the containment response in order to reduce panic, counteract fake news and reassure the population that the government has everything under control. While some people might be able to work from home, others won't be able to, so it's expected that there will be some temporary decline in economic output from the regions most affected by the viral outbreak, though state banks could provide low-interest loans to help mitigate the overall impact.",
            "Above all, nobody should ever lose sight of the fact that ensuring the public's safety is much more important than maintaining quarterly economic figures, and this is as relevant when talking about the national public as much as the global one. In the worst-case scenario, international lending institutions could provide emergency aid to countries where the economic consequences of this outbreak could have political implications. By learning from China's experiences over the past month, the world can prevent this from becoming a pandemic.",

            "U.S. lawmakers held a number of hearings on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, aimed at clarifying Washingtons response to COVID-19.A House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing in the morning was cut short, after members of the presidents task force on coronavirus--who were answering questions from lawmakers--said they were needed back at the White House for an emergency meeting. More than 1,000 Americans, in nearly 40 states, have now tested positive for COVID-19, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is America's top authority on infectious diseases and a member of the White House task force. \"I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,\" Fauci warned. \"How much worse we'll get will depend on our ability to do two things: to contain the influx of people who are infected coming from the outside, and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country.\"Doing so, many argue, requires more frequent testing across the country. Many local and state agencies complain the federal government has not provided them with the proper resources to keep up with demand. \"I've got an email right here from the city council, mayor and leadership in San Antonio saying they don't have adequate plans on what to do with those who have been who have tested positive, said Republican Congressman Chip Roy, whose Texas district includes the city where evacuees from a cruise ship were being sent. As the committee's witnesses prepared to leave early, a clearly frustrated Roy added, I expect you all to come back down here today.\"\"The U.S. Center sfor Diseases Control (CDC) has sent material to test 75,000 people through the public health system,\" said Dr. John Redd of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at an afternoon House Homeland Security subcommittee hearing. \"And there are over a million tests available through the commercial system.\"But accumulating all of the data has proven to be a challenge. Indeed, some lawmakers said it is difficult to get a full understanding of the extent of infections in the U.S. because commercial labs are not required to report their cases to any centralized public system.While the number of cases are trending downward in China, health officials said their concern now has shifted. \"Europe is the new China,\" said Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC.That statement prompted lawmakers to ask why the same travel restrictions were not being put in place on Europeans, following a spike in infections and deaths in Italy.\"Europe presents a unique problem, because of the Schengen zone and their borders,\" said Ken Cuccinelli, the Acting Deputy Secretary at theDepartment of Homeland Security, referring to Europe's freedom of movement policy that did away with most intra-European border controls. \"There are 29 countries here. Does treating Italy as an individual entity even make sense?\" he asked.Cuccinelli said the Europeans are sufficiently conducting airport screenings onthose exiting, at least enough to assure American officials. And because the number of travelers has significantly dropped, screeningarriving passengers from Europe--or altogether restricting them--would require significant resources that couldbebetter spent elsewhere.Later in the day, U.S. President Donald Trump met with bank executives behind closed doors at the White House. Trump is pushing Congress to pass an economic relief plan that will help Americans financially affected by the spread of COVID-19 and the ensuing responses. He is hoping American banks can also help mitigate the economicuncertainty that has left many Americans worried. Trump also announced he would make a further statement on the U.S. response to the outbreak later Wednesday evening."

The structural similarities between China's war on the coronavirus and its war on poverty are striking.",

            "\"What you have to balance that against if we have an entirely new unknown medicine, and we have to make sure that it's safe.\"",
            "Money to be made, lives to be saved",
            "The pharmaceutical and biotech industries are vital to the production of a vaccine. \"There needs to be a strong collaboration between the world's scientists and then, of course, the manufacturers, to get it into production,\" said Lindmeier.",
            "Depending on the size of the outbreak, vaccines can also lead to financial windfalls for producers.",
            "Stocks in U.S. biotechnology company Moderna, which is developing a coronavirus vaccine with CEPI, have risen more than 10 percent in the weeks following the outbreak. While stock in Regeneron Pharmaceutical, which is developing a vaccine alongside the U.S. department of health, soared by 13 percent last week after the company announced it would be ready to test its drug on humans in a matter of months.",
            "Balancing profits with public service is a long-standing issue in the pharmaceutical industry. An infamous 2018 report from Goldman Sachs titled Is curing patients a sustainable business model? garnered plenty of negative press, while companies that produce successful treatments one year can be financially ruined the next.",
            "The report warned, in reference to a successful hepatitis C treatment, that: \"Curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients.\" A pharmaceutical or biotech company can find there is a limited market for vaccines, a one-off purchase, compared with widespread conditions such as cancer. A company can also be reluctant to mass produce a vaccine only to find, by the time the vaccine is available, the outbreak is over.",

            "A solution to expand the market for vaccinations was laid out by Rolf Hilgenfeld in the scientific journal, Nature. Hilgenfeld, a coronavirus research expert at the University of Lbeck, in Germany, has been trying to develop coronavirus vaccines since the 2002-03 SARS outbreak. He and his team have recently created compounds that not only fight coronaviruses but are also effective against a large group of enteroviruses, one of which (enterovirus-71) affects half a million children annually.",
            "\"We can get pharma involved. Then, if we have something approved for those, we can use the drug quickly next time there is a coronavirus outbreak,\" Hilgenfeld told Nature.",
            "A further problem can be cooperation. Osman Dar, director of the Global Health program's One Health project at Chatham House, told CGTN Europe: \"It's still quite a competitive space and there's not been enough technological transfer between specialist groups.\"",
            "In a pandemic, these issues can come to the fore. Dar explained that: \"Even if you have a vaccine... who gets access to the vaccine, which countries is it being produced in and manufactured in, often those countries will say 'we need to keep these for ourselves, in case millions of people in our country get affected.'\"",
            "In Dar's ideal scenario, \"each global region has its own capacity to assess and diagnose  the laboratories, skills and technologies  to both be able to detect and also to develop vaccines, diagnostic tests and also have the manufacturing capacity.\"",
            "Dar called for a furthering of cooperation between researchers, medical institutions and private companies. While currently there are a lack of \"international agreements, which allows for the distributions and sharing of vaccines,\" he explained, the WHO has been attempting to \"bring a bit of synergy to vaccine development for the benefit of humanity.\""

But high-ranking conservative clerics had previously dismissed calls to suspend the opening of the holy shrine in Qom, one of the most sacred religious sites in Shia Islam that attracts visitors from across the Muslim world, under the belief that the U.S. is behind the effort to linking the virus to Qom because it is attempting to undermine the religious institution.",

            "The declaration of an emergency is rare, but not unprecedented: this is the sixth time since 2010 that the World Health Organization has declared such an emergency (Public Health Emergency of International Concern). The decision is reasonable and evidence-based, not intended to induce panic but simply to ensure that there is a global response to a potential global threat. There is also an ongoing emergency in the Democratic Republic of Congo over an Ebola outbreak which began last year.",
            "Cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in every region of China, and 18 other countries worldwide. More than 9,000 cases have now been reported worldwide, with 171 deaths in China as of the press time.",

            "The problem with 2019-nCov is that the symptoms are often mild enough, at least at first, for the infected persons to still be walking around and infecting others. If the virus spreads globally beyond any chance of containing it, the death toll could be significant  not, perhaps, as bad as the most outlandish claims of tabloid newspapers, but still a clear global emergency.",
            "It's still possible that, a couple of months from now, the virus will be completely under control and cases will drop  that the international medical response will be sufficient to eradicate this new coronavirus on its own. Governments cannot assume that this will be the case. They have to apply the precautionary principle, being ready and prepared for the worst-case scenario.",

Human nature is to fear the unknown; with a 24-hour news cycle, people in countries without a single case of the coronavirus are being made aware of it on an hourly basis.",
            "It is still most likely that this virus can be beaten before it becomes a global pandemic affecting hundreds of millions of people across the world. If such a disaster is averted, it will be a result of an unprecedented rapid response to such a significant threat. In that context, I welcome the World Health Organization's decision: the more resources that become available to keep the virus under control, the better.",

            "\"Many people died, the age or the fact that they were old doesn't matter, nothing changes. They just died. So there is a bit of sadness, maybe also because of the gloomy day, there is no sun and the sky is overcast.\"",
            "The contagion in Italy came to light just two weeks ago and has hit the country hard, with 148 deaths and 3,858 cases recorded nationwide, according to the latest data. Some 98 of the deaths were registered in Lombardy alone.",
            "Looking to slow the spread of the virus, the government on Wednesday ordered all schools and universities across the country to close until at least March 15, banned all public gatherings and told cinemas and theaters they had to close.",
            "For those already in the red zone nothing changed, but Toniolo said he feared the quarantine in his area would not be lifted this weekend, as many had hoped and expected.",
            "\"I fear the closure of red zones will be extended by at least a week, but it is not certain,\" said Toniolo, adding he was thinking of ways of getting his pupils back together.",
            "\"I thought about teaching them in the open air, maybe in a meadow or in a field,\" he said. \"We could do some exercises without going ahead with the teaching program [...] we can revise previous lessons and do activities.\""

            "Central China's Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, is expected to report no new cases by the end of March, said Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, during an interview with People's Daily on Tuesday.",
            "The judgement is based on the overall trend of the outbreak and so not absolute, said Zhang, adding that there might be a few new cases occasionally.",
            "When asked how long people have to wear masks, Zhang estimated that by the end of April the majority provinces and cities in China can go back to normal. People can take off their masks by then but Hubei Province will be an exception, as it will take more time to recover.",
            "\"Wearing masks or not should not be a problem. Instead, people should stick to healthy habits,\" he suggested.",
            "Lessons learned from the outbreak",
            "A complete ban on the wildlife trade. \"The price for this epidemic is so high that we must take it more seriously. We should not forget the scar left by SARS so quickly,\" Zhang said.",
            "\"So the first thing we need to do this time is to cut it at the roots. We must put an end to all wildlife trade and the consumption of terrestrial wildlife,\" he added.",
            "In the wake of the deadly coronavirus, China has rolled out a strict ban nationwide on the consumption and farming of wildlife, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.",
            "Revising Contagious Disease Law. Zhang pointed that one of the biggest loopholes in this health crisis is the reporting system. When an outbreak emerges, who should be the first person to report it, and who should the person report to?",
            "\"The hierarchy is so complicated that big things become smaller when finally the message goes to the top decision-makers,\" he said. \"China's Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Disease Law should be revised.\"",
            "Improving community-based medical services. A lot of fever patients flocked to big public hospitals in the early days of the outbreak, which increased their risks of exposure to cross-infection. Many people were only infected with seasonal influenza at first.",
            "Zhang said community-based clinics were supposed to play a vital role in disease prevention. If the medical facilities are strong enough to handle part of the situation, the outbreak may probably be controlled in the early stage.",
            "Never forget to give credit to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). As the president of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhang has seen the effectiveness of TCM in saving people's lives.",
            "China's National Health Commission prescribes the use of TCM alongside Western drugs in its guidelines for the treatment of infected people with the coronavirus.",
            "According to frontline medical staff, western drugs target the virus and resist infection, while TCM helps to relieve patients' symptoms. The two methods complement each other.",

            "The fatality rate for the novel coronavirus outbreak is expected to decrease, said Zhong Nanshan, a renowned Chinese respiratory expert, in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday.",
            "\"So far, no medication has been developed to specifically target the virus, but scientists and medical workers have explored many ways. As great improvement has also been made in the life support system, the fatality rate is expected to drop further,\" he said.",
            "According to Zhong, the outbreak may reach its peak in one week or around 10 days. \"It remains a hard task to estimate with absolute certainty when the epidemic will reach its peak. But it should be in seven to 10 days and without massive build-up.\"",
            "\"A quarantine between 10 to 14 days would be good. When the latency is over, we will give timely treatment to patients, and those without clinical symptoms do not actually have the disease,\" Zhong said, adding that there will be no large-scale infection due to the return trips of the Spring Festival rush but the screening measures of the virus cannot be stopped.",
            "The expert also suggested that in addition to infectious disease specialists, hospitals must also be equipped with experts specializing in life-threatening cases to better rescue patients.",
            "\"To deal with the epidemic, we must seize two key points, early detection and timely quarantine,\" Zhong said. \"These two are the most primitive and effective methods.\"",
            "Does the virus mutate?",
            "The National Health Commission announced some confirmed cases have no obvious symptoms at the initial stage so people are worried about whether the new strain of coronavirus has mutated into a more infectious virus.",
            "Zhong told Xinhua virus mutation doesn't simply refer to the changed symptoms, instead a mutated virus means its virulence became stronger. But based on the analysis of current situation, most of the symptoms are just having a fever, cough, running nose, and a few of them have gastrointestinal disorders.",
            "A recent piece of research published on the medical journal The Lancet suggested that the first confirmed case with symptoms never went to the seafood market, the origin of the new virus outbreak, suggesting that there may be other virus sources",
            "But Zhong rejected the suspicion, saying it's hard to deny the link between the patients and the source of the virus.",
            "\"The novel coronavirus is homologous to the one found in bats in 2017. It is transmitted to humans through an intermediate host,\" he said, also mentioning they are matching the virus gene sequence with the gene library to filter out other homologous virus hosts.",
            "\"It is highly possible that the intermediate host is another wildlife animal,\" Zhong added. The intermediate host of SARS virus which killed over 800 people in 2003 worldwide was the civet cat.",
            "\"The SARS outbreak lasted about six months, but I don't believe the novel coronavirus outbreak would last that long,\" said Zhong.",
