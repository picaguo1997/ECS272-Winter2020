I think it\u2019s still going to go up, because again, the asymptomatic [phase] of a couple of weeks.

It\u2019s not as though she went to a grocery store and now the check-out clerk has coronavirus.\u201d", "The novel coronavirus has a mortality rate of less than two percent, according to the United Kingdom\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof. Chris Whitty.", "\u201cAmericans, please do not be overly concerned about the coronavirus, right now,\u201d said Saphier. \u201cI want to remind everyone that about one in ten Americans will get the flu, and about 35,000 Americans die every year from the flu.\u201d", "Saphier added, \u201cThe same thing I would say [about] the flu: good hand hygiene, avoid sick contacts, and at this time you can\u2019t travel to China so you\u2019re not going to travel to China.\u201d", "\u201cIf you you\u2019ve been to China or in contact with people who\u2019ve recently traveled to China, get tested,\u201d advised Saphier.", "\u201c[Chinese authorities] were not very forthcoming with information when it came to SARS, which is why that became such a bigger outbreak than it needed to be,\u201d Saphier said. \u201cThe communist-run government was trying to hide a lot of the information and keep it hidden from the world. Luckily, they\u2019re not doing that with the coronavirus, right now. They are choosing what goes into their media, as they do, but it does seem that they\u2019re being more forthcoming with information, and now that the World Health Organization has declared an emergency, they are going to have to be even more forthcoming in the future to make sure that it does get under control.\u201d", "\u201cThe way [China] handled SARS was very inappropriate, [but] they are handling coronavirus,\u201d Saphier added. \u201cThe fact that the first reported case was December 31st, and they\u2019ve already sequenced the virus in less than a month, that is infinitely better than what happened with SARS.\u201d", "\u201c[Chinese authorities] want to maintain a positive light in public opinion,\u201d Saphier continued. \u201cTheir government-run media concerns me in the sense that they are posting pictures of nurses helping patients, but the Chinese healthcare system is in shambles. They are low on doctors, there is over-utilization of emergency rooms, [and] there\u2019s violence against healthcare workers. They\u2019re putting out this picture of harmony, but the truth is I know that the healthcare system there is terrible and they are lacking stuff for contact precautions.\u201d", "\u201cThis virus is in droplets, so when you sneeze [or] cough, that\u2019s how it can get contracted. They need gloves, they need masks, and they didn\u2019t have a lot of that,\u201d remarked Saphier.", "Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.

It\u2019s for those travelers who are returning back from those countries where the virus is at an outbreak.\u201d", "Still, the\u00a0DCHHS issued\u00a0the CDC\u2019s interim guidelines advising men who return from travel in Zika affected areas to abstain from sex with their pregnant partners or wear condoms for the duration of the pregnancy.", "Neroes said that Dallas County testing will apply to\u00a0residents in the outlying Collin, Ellis, Fannin, Grayson, Henderson, Hunt, Kaufman, Navarro, Rains, Rockwall, and Van Zant counties. She\u00a0advised individuals residing in other Texas counties to contact the CDC for information on labs that serve their areas.", "Last week, Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) launched\u00a0a Zika virus task force as did Governor Greg Abbott. The governor appointed\u00a0 a 31 member infectious disease disease preparedness and response task force to address the Zika virus, which Breitbart Texas\u2019 Lana Shadwick reported.", "Dallas may not be the only municipality about to begin local testing for Zika virus. Carrie Williams with the Texas Department of State Health Services told Breitbart Texas by email that \u201cTexas is pursing the ability to test statewide at our lab in Austin, and we should have that up and running soon.\u201d\u00a0Williams also commented about the Dallas task force, \u201cI think we are all in agreement that we need to work to do everything we can to prevent a Zika virus outbreak here. We\u2019re supportive of local efforts to stay on top of this disease.\u201d", "Mosquito season in North Texas starts in May. There are 10 cases of Zika virus in the state presently. All but one was travel-related, contracted\u00a0while in a Zika infested country. The outstanding Dallas County case turned out to the\u00a0first US case of sexually transmitted Zika virus\u00a0acquired through a man who contracted Zika while in Venezuela.", "As local health officials gear up to test for Zika locally, they also await the results of four more suspected travel-related cases of\u00a0the\u00a0virus to return from the CDC.", "Dallas has faced other challenging health threats in recent years. Breitbart Texas reported comprehensively on the 2014 Ebola scare, prompted by a Liberian man infected with the deadly West African virus. He brought the first case of Ebola into the U.S. through Dallas, which spread to two nurses treating him. He later died. Although contained, fears of the Ebola virus spreading into the general population created a lot of frayed nerves across the Metroplex for months. In 2012, Dallas County tackled a West Nile virus epidemic in which County Judge Clay Jenkins declared a state of emergency.", "Also Monday, President Obama said he would ask Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to fight the virus. The U.S. Olympic Committee recommended athletes concerned about the Zika virus outbreak in Latin American countries should not attend the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, although Breitbart News reported it will be winter in the southern hemisphere at the time. Officials hope the cooler weather will kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito known to carry Zika, diminishing its threat.", "For now, the DCHHS continues to recommend reducing exposure to mosquito bites

If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.\u201d", "Zubrin observes the pesticide\u2019s history:", "DDT was first employed by the U.S. Army to stop a typhus epidemic in Naples that had been created by the retreating Germans through their destruction of that city\u2019s sanitation system. Subsequently, Allied forces used it in all theaters to save millions of disease-ravaged victims of Axis tyranny, and after the war employed it to wipe out malaria in the American south, southern Europe, and much of south Asia and Latin America. The benefits of these campaigns were unprecedented. As the National Academy of Sciences put it in a 1970 report: To only a few chemicals does man owe as great a debt as to DDT. It has contributed to the great increase of agricultural productivity, while sparing countless humanity from a host of diseases, most notably perhaps, scrub typhus and malaria. Indeed, it is estimated that in little more than two decades, DDT has prevented 500 million deaths due to malaria that would otherwise have been inevitable.", "Zubrin asserts that environmentalists such as Rachel Carson, author of the 1962 book Silent Spring, propagated the notion that DDT was harmful to bird populations.", "\u201cThis was false,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn fact, by eliminating their insect parasites and infection agents, DDT was helping bird numbers to grow significantly.\u201d", "Nevertheless, Zubrin notes environmentalists launched an aggressive \u201cmassive propaganda campaign\u201d that would ultimately ban the use of DDT.", "According to Orient, Zika is not a new virus, having been first identified in humans in 1947 in Uganda\u2019s Zika Forest. Nevertheless, CDC director Thomas Frieden observes the virus\u2019s association with microcephaly and other fetal harm.", "\u201cThere is no definitive proof that ZVD has caused birth defects,\u201d Orient notes. \u201cIn fact, the evidence is against it. In Colombia, 3000 pregnant women had ZVD \u2014 with no microcephaly. In Brazil, only 17 of 404 cases of confirmed microcephaly were positive for ZVD. ZVD has been known since the 1940s as a benign disease, with no reported birth defects.\u201d", "Orient also advises against exposing women who may be pregnant to drugs or vaccines that have not been through thorough safety testing. She notes that, last year, Brazil mandated the pertussis vaccine for all pregnant women \u2014 without proof of safety during pregnancy.", "Regarding the fear that Zika could spread through the United States via illegal immigrants, Orient believes that ZVD is perhaps one of the least important of the kinds of diseases that could be transmitted in that way. A concern she has is that President Obama proposes to spend $1.8 billion on the ZVD threat \u2014 which is now being used politically to promote abortion in countries where it is currently illegal

mosquito control and says, \u201cDDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time.\u201d", "Orient continues:", "The ban on DDT was basically the decision of one man, William Ruckelshaus, going against a mountain of evidence on safety and enormous health benefits. It was said that, \u201cIf they can ban DDT, they can ban anything.\u201d And that\u2019s how the EPA power grab started. Millions of African babies have died and are still dying of malaria because if it.", "\u201cSubstitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,\u201d she adds.\u00a0\u201cPeople are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET \u2014 which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.\u201d", "Orient\u2019s view is shared by president of Pioneer Energy Dr. Robert Zubrin, who recently wrote at National Review, \u201cThe most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.\u201d", "Zubrin observes the pesticide\u2019s history:", "DDT was first employed by the U.S. Army to stop a typhus epidemic in Naples that had been created by the retreating Germans through their destruction of that city\u2019s sanitation system. Subsequently, Allied forces used it in all theaters to save millions of disease-ravaged victims of Axis tyranny, and after the war employed it to wipe out malaria in the American south, southern Europe, and much of south Asia and Latin America. The benefits of these campaigns were unprecedented. As the National Academy of Sciences put it in a 1970 report: To only a few chemicals does man owe as great a debt as to DDT. It has contributed to the great increase of agricultural productivity, while sparing countless humanity from a host of diseases, most notably perhaps, scrub typhus and malaria. Indeed, it is estimated that in little more than two decades, DDT has prevented 500 million deaths due to malaria that would otherwise have been inevitable.", "Zubrin asserts that environmentalists such as Rachel Carson, author of the 1962 book Silent Spring, propagated the notion that DDT was harmful to bird populations.", "\u201cThis was false,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn fact, by eliminating their insect parasites and infection agents, DDT was helping bird numbers to grow significantly.\u201d", "Nevertheless, Zubrin notes environmentalists launched an aggressive \u201cmassive propaganda campaign\u201d that would ultimately ban the use of DDT.", "According to Orient, Zika is not a new virus, having been first identified in humans in 1947 in Uganda\u2019s Zika Forest. Nevertheless, CDC director Thomas Frieden observes the virus\u2019s association with microcephaly and other fetal harm.", "\u201cThere is no definitive proof that ZVD has caused birth defects,\u201d Orient notes. \u201cIn fact, the evidence is against it. In Colombia, 3000 pregnant women had ZVD \u2014 with no microcephaly. In Brazil, only 17 of 404 cases of confirmed microcephaly were positive for ZVD. ZVD has been known since the 1940s as a benign disease, with no reported birth defects.\u201d", "Orient also advises against exposing women who may be pregnant to drugs or vaccines that have not been through thorough safety testing. She notes that, last year, Brazil mandated the pertussis vaccine for all pregnant women \u2014 without proof of safety during pregnancy.", "Regarding the fear that Zika could spread through the United States via illegal immigrants, Orient believes that ZVD is perhaps one of the least important of the kinds of diseases that could be transmitted in that way. A concern she has is that President Obama proposes to spend $1.8 billion on the ZVD threat \u2014 which is now being used politically to promote abortion in countries where it is currently illegal \u2014 while \u201cother genuine threats proliferate.\u201d", "\u201cWe could stop transmission now with effective mosquito control in affected areas,\u201d Orient says."], "content-summary": " Orient

been invisible for most of the crisis. Xi used the epidemic as leverage to demand total obedience from his subjects at a moment when popular discontent with his rule has reached an all-time high, shifting blame for the outbreak and various abuses of public trust to lower-level local officials.", "China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news service summarized key points from the speech (referred to as \u201cthe article\u201d) on Saturday:", "The article stresses the importance of securing success in the prevention and control work, pointing out that the outcome of the epidemic prevention and control directly affects people\u2019s lives and health, the overall economic and social stability and the country\u2019s opening-up.", "Resources for treatment, prevention and protection must be sent to the front line of the battle against the epidemic and priority should be given to meet the needs of frontline medical staff and patients, according to the article.", "All-out efforts should be made to improve the admission and survival rates, and reduce the infection and mortality rates, the article says.", "The article underlines the need to safeguard social stability, the promotion of public education and communication, as well as ensuring a stable economic performance.", "It also stresses improving the country\u2019s emergency management system and capacity of handling urgent, difficult, dangerous and important tasks.", "The state-run Global Times conjured up some \u201canalysts\u201d who were floored by Xi\u2019s magnificent speech and praised his \u201ctransparent\u201d leadership on the coronavirus, even though the big political story in China over the past two months has been Xi disappearing and leaving Premier Li Kequiang holding the virus hot potato:", "Analysts noted that Xi, the leader of the Party and the country, is leading the fight against the COVID-19 in a very transparent and responsible manner, directly addressing public discontent and meeting people\u2019s expectations. It is very rarely seen that a speech by the president at a senior-level meeting included so many details, direct instructions and harsh criticisms on the problems, especially during the fight against the virus.", "At the very beginning of the article, Xi noted that he has made requirements on work to prevent and control the COVID-19 on January 7 since the outbreak started while presiding a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.\u00a0", "Chinese experts said that the CPC Central Committee is playing the most significant role in this war on the virus which needs to mobilize a country with a 1.4 billion population.", "\u201cCOVID-19\u201d is the medical terminology for the virus.

It is a comprehensive war, and all effort must lend support to winning this battle in preventing and controlling the epidemic.", "The implementation of the CPC Central Committee\u2019s instructions at all levels is generally good, the article noted, but also stressed the need to strengthen areas of weakness and close loopholes exposed by the current epidemic.", "Shen Yi, head of Fudan University\u2019s Cyberspace Governance Research Institute, said that the article shows an honest and transparent attitude, as a very serious problem that was exposed since the beginning of the outbreak is that \u201ca few officials at local level governments didn\u2019t effectively implement the instructions from the CPC Central Committee and also didn\u2019t reflect the real situation at the time.\u201d", "\u201cThe CPC Central Committee is aware of a situation on January 7, but due to this kind of problem (inefficient implementation), it caused some loopholes and mistakes, and fortunately the Party has a strong capability of self-correction, and now the damage over the credibility of the government has been generally fixed and recovered,\u201d Song said.", "CNN suspected the \u201csituation on January 7\u201d described in the new Communist Party virus mythology was a reference to the massive banquet that was regrettably held in Wuhan just as the virus was exploding out of control. The first two weeks of January were a particularly grim chapter in the tale of the coronavirus, as it represented the last efforts of Chinese officials to pretend the situation was completely under control and the virus was not particularly dangerous.", "Under gale-force political spin pumped out by Xinhua and the Global Times, the new story is that Xi was secretly in control the whole time, but idiotic local officials (and an equally foolish team of researchers dispatched from Beijing that claimed the virus was under control on January 11) botched Xi\u2019s orders and misinformed him.", "Ultimately, however, the awkwardness of sharing some of the blame with Hubei officials might be preferable to admitting that Xi and those around him were potentially unaware or ill-informed about what was really going on.", "The Associated Press thought the new mythology made Xi and other top CCP officials vulnerable to criticism that they knew how dangerous the Wuhan virus was but did not take firm action until the epidemic was so huge that it could no longer be ignored:", "The disclosure of his speech indicates top leaders knew about the outbreak\u2019s potential severity at least two weeks before such dangers were made known to the public. It was not until late January that officials said the virus can spread between humans and public alarm began to rise.", "Zhang Lifan, a commentator in Beijing, said it\u2019s not clear why the speech was published now. One message could be that local authorities should take responsibility for failing to take effective measures after Xi gave instructions in early January. Alternatively, it may mean that Xi, as the top leader, is willing to take responsibility because he was aware of the situation, Zhang said.", "Bloomberg News found it \u201cperplexing\u201d that Xi would attempt a wholesale rewriting of coronavirus history, producing an altered timeline that most Chinese citizens know is false. Skeptics are greatly underestimating the CCP\u2019s ability to force its citizens to believe in edited versions of history, and the ability of Communist leaders to pin blame for their shortcomings on underlings. A great many local officials will be scapegoated to make Xi\u2019s new timeline stick, with some of them probably ending up in prison or worse, but there will be plenty of replacement officials to take their places.", "On Monday, Xinhua pumped out supplementary propaganda to cover Xi\u2019s flank, portraying the international community as dazzled by Xi\u2019s leadership and claiming the epidemic makes China look more responsible and transparent to the world community, not less. Amusingly, Xinhua had to turn to the general secretary of the Egyptian Communist Party to get a really good fawning quote about China\u2019s \u201creally impressive,\u201d \u201cresolute,\u201d and \u201cdecisive\u201d measures to battle the virus.", "Chinese state media on Monday claimed the Wuhan virus outbreak is coming under control, with fewer new cases reported for three consecutive days following a huge spike in new infections last week.

estimates that 60.8 million Americans contracted the H1N1 virus. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, the virus led to more than 12,000 deaths in a population of 300 million, a number that is hardly on par with the medical standards of a developed nation.", "Additionally, CDC estimates that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from the H1N1 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.", "Well, at least they declared it a public health emergency. However, the US government clearly failed to take enough measures to control it.", "This was followed by the Communist Party\u2019s familiar lament that ordinary influenza outbreaks supposedly infect and kill more people than the Wuhan coronavirus, but no one makes a big deal about the flu, plus some carping about the disaster response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.", "The People\u2019s Daily wrapped up by quoting the same politically useful statements from the World Health Organization (WHO) that Chinese propaganda repeats on a daily basis:", "Just like WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said in his speech: \u201cThere is a window of opportunity because of the strong measures China is taking at the epicenter, at the source.\u201d", "Facts and numbers have clearly displayed the truth: China\u2019s speed, scale, and efficiency all demonstrate the strengths of its system.", "US politicians should stop pointing figures at others, especially if the US government is unable to act in times of public emergency. At the very least, they can shut their mouths if they cannot provide actual help to the world.", "Another People\u2019s Daily article lamented that the U.S. is not doling out foreign aid quickly enough:", "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced recently on social media that Washington would offer up to $100 million to China and other countries affected by the coronavirus to combat its spread, saying \u201cThis commitment demonstrates strong U.S. leadership in response to the outbreak.\u201d", "However, when asked about the implementation of the fund at a news conference held on Feb.10 in Washington, James Richardson, director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources at the State Department, said the $100 million was just an upper limit.", "Except for some assigned projects to help Laos, he didn\u2019t disclose further details about the fund.", "Any constructive international cooperation shall be welcomed in this global public health challenge, including the assistance promised by the U.S. for Southeast Asian countries such as Laos.", "However, people would question that the implementation of the assistance obviously doesn\u2019t match what Washington has promised.

This is partly related to so-called American exceptionalism, which presumes that US values, political system, and history are worthy of universal admiration. It indicates that the US is both destined and entitled to play a distinct role at the world stage. This provides the US with a pretext to promote its global hegemony, set double standards and meddle in internal affairs of other countries.", "When dealing with countries like China, whose ideology and political system are totally different from those in the West, the double standards imposed by the US tend to be more severe.", "As the world\u2019s only superpower, Washington is supposed to shoulder more responsibility during a global health emergency. It should be providing more health-care material aid and proactively leading or organizing international cooperation. At the very least, the US should maintain neutrality toward the outbreak and show sympathy toward the people suffering from the epidemic, rather than add insult to injury.", "The Global Times theorized that U.S. \u201cprejudice\u201d could be why it challenges the accuracy of coronavirus information released by China, speculated that offers of assistance could be a pretext for American troops to conduct \u201cmilitary missions to detect China\u2019s capabilities in biochemical research,\u201d muttered about links between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the military, and concluded by wondering if Washington isn\u2019t delivering all the help it was racist to offer because of President Trump\u2019s selfish and xenophobic \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.", "The dangerous thing about all this political spin is that it goes beyond the Chinese Communist Party nursing its wounded pride. The Chinese are desperate to get normal travel and commerce flowing again, no matter the risks posed to foreign populations by the Wuhan coronavirus.", "International organizations are reluctant to provoke Beijing\u2019s ire by openly accusing it of providing false information about the number of infections and deaths. China is trying to leverage that reluctance and force the rest of the world to embrace its political narratives about the epidemic, but the cold, hard truth is that most of the world knows it would be much safer to wait for independent confirmation that the epidemic really is receding.\u00a0", "At the moment, roughly ten percent of the immense Chinese population is living under some form of quarantine or lockdown.

Jinping and China\u2019s Communist Party Central Committee forced 170,000 Party officials and military leaders on Sunday to watch Xi deliver a speech via teleconference on the chaos nationwide caused by the ongoing outbreak of Wuhan coronavirus.", "The virus \u2013 officially given the cumbersome name \u201cCOVID-19\u201d to attempt to disassociate it with its country of origin \u2013 has infected nearly 80,000 people as of Monday and killed over 2,600, most of them in China. Wuhan, the city where the virus first began to spread in December, is currently on lockdown, forbidding people to leave the house outside of government-controlled trips to buy food and other basic supplies. Every province of China has documented cases of the virus and a study released last week indicated that Beijing was wrong to conclude that the virus originated in a wild meat market in the city.", "\u201cThis is a crisis for us and it is also a major test,\u201d Xi reportedly told the viewers, which included county Communist Party officials from the entire nation and senior military leaders. Xi urged them to learn from the \u201cobvious shortcomings exposed\u201d by the virus the\u00a0South China Morning Post noted him saying, and then offered vague, simple commands such as telling the Party to \u201cresolutely curb the spread of epidemic\u201d and \u201cincrease the rate of treatment and cure\u201d in Wuhan.", "Outside of Wuhan and its Hubei province, Xi insisted on placing major emphasis on containing the virus in Beijing, where he lives. The\u00a0Morning Post noted that he and the senior leaders of the Communist Politburo were the only ones in the broadcast not wearing sanitary masks.", "The newspaper did not list any shortcomings that Xi may have specifically identified. Among the failures of the Chinese government since the outbreak began were not telling hospital staff in Wuhan to quarantine patients because the virus is contagious, arresting doctors who warned other health professionals that they had reason to believe the virus was dangerous, and pouring more resources into silencing criticism of the government over the response online than into actually combatting the outbreak.", "Radio Free Asia (RFA), which uses dissident reports on the ground, reported last week that the situation in Wuhan has worsened in part because of the number of healthcare workers who are fighting the virus themselves after testing positive for it. At least three of Wuhan\u2019s high-profile doctors have died in the ensuing outbreak. The highest-ranking doctor, Liu Zhiming, was the director of the city\u2019s central hospital. Li Wenliang, the first doctor identified to have died of coronavirus, was arrested and humiliated by Wuhan police after posting a warning to a closed doctors\u2019 group on WeChat that he believed the virus was contagious. Chinese propaganda attempted to portray him as a Party hero, but his death triggered significant outrage nationwide against the government. The third doctor, Peng Yinhua, appeared in Party propaganda because he had delayed his wedding to stay in Wuhan and help treat patients. Peng was 29 years old.", "RFA cited several anonymous sources in Wuhan who said they had seen other hospital directors and doctors struggling to work while sick with coronavirus. It added that the outbreak appears to be worsening because health workers simply do not have the equipment necessary to protect themselves.", "RFA has also called into question on several occasions the official government death count, noting that sources in Wuhan have evidence of constant cremations at city crematoria. The\u00a0Epoch Times similarly reported this month that Wuhan is cremating hundreds of coronavirus victims a day, an unsustainable rate if the official death toll is accurate.", "At press time, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 79,407 cases of coronavirus and 2,622 deaths, the overwhelming majority in China. The virus has spread to nearly every continent; South Korea and Iran are believed to have some of the highest numbers of patients.", "Instead of mentioning these concerns, Xi praised the communist system, claiming the out-of-control circumstances in China are somehow proof of the supremacy of communism as a political system.", "\u201cThe effectiveness of the prevention and control work has once again demonstrated the significant advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,\u201d he reportedly said, also predicting that China\u2019s economy would thrive despite the virus rendering most manufacturing impossible.", "The\u00a0Global Times, a Chinese government propaganda outlet, called the \u201cmeeting\u201d \u2013 which did not require Xi to actually meet most of the attendees \u2013 \u201cunprecedented,\u201d \u201chistoric,\u201d and \u201cremarkable.\u201d It applauded Xi, citing Chinese \u201cexperts,\u201d for organizing the meeting, without addressing the actual outbreak response.", "\u201cPresident Xi understands very well the frontline situation, which is also impressive,\u201d an unnamed \u201cParty secretary\u201d reportedly told the\u00a0Global Times after listening to Xi\u2019s speech. Similarly, the government-controlled Xinhua news agency claimed that the speech elicited praise from \u201cscholars and observers around the world.\u201d", "While Chinese media repeatedly referred to

It condemned the Chinese communist regime for failing to alert residents earlier about the outbreak to ensure that people took safety precautions, particularly at crowded events and in hospitals: \u201cIf the warning [after the market shut down in January] had attracted more attention, the number of cases both nationally and globally in mid-to-late January would have been reduced.\u201d", "\u201cThe study concerning whether Huanan market is the only birthplace of SARS-CoV-2 is of great significance for finding its source and determining the intermediate host, so as to control the epidemic and prevent it from spreading again,\u201d the scientists noted.", "The latest study joins a much earlier one published in the medical journal\u00a0The Lancet in January, which also called into question the official claim that the Wuhan wildlife meat market was responsible for the outbreak. That study found a case in which a patient with no links to the market got sick on December 1, one of the first to be identified as a patient. Of the 41 patients studied, 13 did not appear to have any connection to the market.", "Huang Chaolin, one of the doctors who wrote the\u00a0Lancet study, told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua that the new case did not necessarily mean that the virus did not originate at the market, but that there may be more than one source responsible for the spread of the disease.", "The\u00a0Lancet study did not prevent a frenzy to identify the wild meat allegedly responsible for the virus, resulting in a wide variety of theories on whether bats, snakes, mice, badgers, or other pests could have carried the disease. As there is little supervision in what sorts of animals people bring to the market and most are killed live on site, even confirmation of the market as the source of the virus would leave many questions unanswered.\u00a0Dr. Emily Landon at the University of Chicago explains:", "These markets have been known to transmit viruses before. For cultural reasons in the region, people want to see the specific animals they\u2019re buying be slaughtered in front of them, so they know they\u2019re receiving the products they paid for. That means there\u2019s a lot of skinning of dead animals in front of shoppers and, as a result, aerosolizing of all sorts of things, which is why these crowded markets are common places for viruses to jump from animals to people. It\u2019s actually how\u00a0SARS, another coronavirus, started in 2003.", "Adding to the initial confusion were reports on video allegedly showing the Wuhan market, but instead showing locations elsewhere in Southeast Asia that had no known ties to the coronavirus outbreak.", "China is nonetheless considering a nationwide ban on wild meat to prevent other potential outbreaks. The Communist Party has yet to address the most recent study potentially absolving the meat market.", "At press time, global health officials have identified 79,544 cases of coronavirus worldwide, most in China, Over 2,600 people have died after being diagnosed with the virus. For weeks, Chinese officials reportedly denied patients with clear coronavirus symptoms the testing kit necessary to confirm the outbreak, suggesting the number of cases in the country is much higher

I knew back in January when the first reports came out of China that they\u2019d been hiding it for weeks. I know that they\u2019ve had a bioweapons program in place in China for decades. I know that they have only one level 4 laboratory in China, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, a city with \u2026 probably 15 million people.\u201d", "LISTEN:", "Mosher continued, \u201cBut then we have new evidence. At an emergency meeting in Beijing held on the 14th of this month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u2014 I might call him dictator Xi, except Michael Bloomberg would object, but he is the dictator \u2014 he held a meeting and he spoke about the need to set up a system to prevent epidemics in the future by increasing lab safety. He said laboratory safety is a national security issue.\u201d", "Mosher went on, \u201cNow, if that isn\u2019t clear enough, the next day, the very next day, [the] Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive, and its title, it\u2019s a little bit long, but pay attention to this, is \u2018instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.\u2019 Wait a minute, wait a minute, \u2018instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in labs that handle viruses like the novel coronavirus\u2019 \u2014 the one virus causing the epidemic \u2014 and you mean to suggest, China, that maybe your lab\u2019s biosecurity management wasn\u2019t very good and that this virus actually escaped from the lab in Wuhan, and now you\u2019re playing catch up after the cat is out of the bag, after the genie is out of the bottle, after the horse has left the barn?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what it certainly sounds like to me,\u201d assessed Mosher. \u201cIt sounds like they have a real problem keeping dangerous pathogens and test tubes where they belong and I\u2019ll tell you this: we know that there have been many, many leaks from China\u2019s biotechnology labs in the past their bioresearch labs are leaky.\u201d", "Mosher remarked, \u201cIn fact, in Beijing a few years ago, they leaked the SARS virus \u2014 that deadly SARS virus. SARS is sudden acute respiratory syndrome. [SARS] killed ten percent of the people that it was communicated to \u2014 at least twice out of a lab in Beijing a few years ago. We know they have a problem with containment of these dangerous pathogens.\u201d", "Mosher stated, \u201cWe know they\u2019re working on them, tinkering with them, doing genetic engineering on them. In fact, this Ministry of Science and Technology now wants to strengthen biosecurity management, [and] has been funding research on coronaviruses for the last ten years. They\u2019ve been taking out segments of the coronavirus RNA and replacing it with other segments from HIV and other things.\u00a0That\u2019s in open source virology research publications.\u201d ", "Chinese researchers may have sold infected laboratory animals used in virology research at a meat market, noted Mosher.", "\u201cSo connect the dots, put everything together,\u201d urged Mosher. \u201cThey were doing research on dangerous coronaviruses in the lab, and it got out of the lab. How did it get out of the lab? Well, this is interesting, too, because you might think that the most likely scenario is a researcher in the lab was careless and got some of the virus on his clothing or actually got infected with the disease then went out into public and infected the public, but there\u2019s another vector. And the other vector is this: that sometimes in China researchers who are buying expensive lab animals, after they get done researching the lab animals, maybe infecting them with coronavirus, they then, if the lab animals are still alive, they then take them to make a little extra money and sell them at the local fresh meat market where they are slaughtered and wind up in someone\u2019s stomach.\u201d", "Mosher added, \u201cNow that\u2019s hard to believe, but it does happen. There are researchers in prison in China today who have done that and who have been caught. The fact is Chinese Communist Party officials try to monetize anything they\u2019re in control of, and if you give a Chinese party official a bunch of free lab animals, he\u2019s going to use them for his research and then, in some cases, instead of cremating them like they\u2019re supposed to, they then turn around and sell them on the meat market.\u201d", "\u201cThere was a meeting in Beijing by the head of the National Health Service of China a few weeks ago, and he instructed [health workers] in all the provinces, cities, and towns of China that the first priority was politics, the second priority was safety, and the third priority was curing the sick,\u201d recalled Mosher.", "China\u2019s quarantine measures are \u201cmore like the guillotine,\u201d determined Mosher. \u201cIt\u2019s more like just amputation, amputating these people out of society, so they won\u2019t infect others.\u201d", "Mosher praised the Trump administration\u2019s policies towards addressing the coronavirus threat.", "\u201cWe took action faster than almost any country,\u201d he said, highlighting President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban foreigners who had recently traveled to China from entering the U.S. He added, \u201cPresident Trump set up a task force with the leading epidemiologists, the leading virologists, [and] the leading figures in the field and he\u2019s giving them all the resources that they need.\u201d", "Mosher concluded, \u201cIf there\u2019s an administration that is capable of handling this kind of crisis, it\u2019s the Trump administration.\u201d", "Breitbart

Health officials urged residents to donate blood now while the supply is not tainted by Zika, meaning no local mosquitoes carry and transmit the virus.", "The press conference also followed a\u00a0week of torrential\u00a0rain storms statewide where\u00a0resulting standing water often proves to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes, in general, especially in warmer weather, now a heightened concern because of Texas\u2019 proximity to Mexico, where local mosquitoes\u00a0now carry and transmit Zika virus.", "\u201cWe want to make sure that San Antonio residents dump any standing water near their homes at least once a week. Treat standing water that can\u2019t be dumped with purification tablets,\u201d commented Wolff, according to San Antonio\u2019s KSAT 12.", "Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0the related fear is that\u00a0Zika-carrying mosquitoes will cross over the border and infect Texans and Texas mosquitoes. Officials\u00a0predict it is only a matter of time before a locally transmitted Zika case occurs and once this happens,\u00a0it could pose a serious threat to the current blood supply, already suffering a shortage.", "STBTC\u00a0launched a\u00a0Now More Than Ever campaign to encourage San Antonio residents to give blood, mainly because donations are down overall not just in San Antonio but around the country. The organization\u2019s website\u00a0notes the trade association for U.S. blood banks, the AABB, cited its most 2013 current statistics that blood donations were at the lowest point since they began keeping records in 1980, showing only 67 out of 1,000 people nationwide donated blood that year. \u201cThe national trend shows blood donations at the lowest level in 30 years,\u201d commented Waltman.", "This is compounded by Zika virus because it forced San Antonio health officials to turn away much needed blood donors, even if only temporarily. STBTC adopted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) guidelines mandating\u00a0potential blood donors who return from travel to Zika affected areas and those who display symptoms characteristic with the virus, wait one month before donating blood.", "STBTC actually asks\u00a0potential blood donors who traveled to Zika affected regions such as in South Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South Americas, or Mexico to wait 28 days upon returning before donating blood, even though there are no known cases of individuals infected with Zika though local mosquitoes in the state of Texas. Additionally, prospective donors who have had sexual contact with a person who just returned from travel to a Zika infested area must wait 28 days, since the virus also spreads through sexual contact. It can spread\u00a0via\u00a0blood transfusions as well.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a big impact on our supply and the availability of blood for people who are sick, going through chemotherapy, and people who are injured,\u201d said Julie Vera, STBTC spokeswoman, who told San Antonio\u2019s Fox 29 the\u00a0current blood shortage in San Antonio could pose a serious problem if the Zika infection hits the area. That scenario could shut down all area blood donations.\u00a0She added that presently the center\u00a0feels the effects of the reduced number of donors within an area that includes Laredo, Eagle Pass, and Del Rio.", "\u201cPeople who have always donated blood we have to defer even if they only went to Mexico for a day,\u201d she added. \u00a0STBTC monitors blood donations for Zika virus. Vera worries the center could face\u00a0empty or \u201creally sparse\u201d\u00a0blood shelves\u00a0over the summer months.", "She urged: \u201cNow more than ever, if you\u2019ve ever considered donating, now is the time to do it.\u201d She also told Fox 29: \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen with Zika transmission this summer. We do know that every summer we have a drop off in our blood supply, so that coupled with the threat of Zika and any other virus that comes our way\u2014it\u2019s a really serious situation that we\u2019re facing.\u201d", "The four known cases of the virus in San Antonio were acquired on travel outside the mainland in\u00a0affected Zika infested regions, Mayor Taylor highlighted.\u00a0Zika is the mosquito-borne\u00a0virus now believed to cause the brain\u00a0birth defect microcephaly in unborn babies and neurological disorders like Guillain-Barr\u00e9\u00a0syndrome, often a temporary paralysis.", "Also Monday, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick requested\u00a0a state committee hearing on the Zika virus and what actions are being taken to control the potential spread of the virus be held in May.\u00a0\u201cWith increasing news

If this discovery is verified and definitively linked to Israel\u2019s intelligence apparatus, it would represent the first concrete evidence that Israel was spying on the negotiations, as everyone informally assumes they were doing.", "As the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0tells it, Kaspersky was penetrated by an upgraded version of the virus known as \u201cDuqu\u201d last year. \u201cCurrent and former U.S. officials and many cybersecurity experts believe Duqu was designed to carry out Israel\u2019s most sensitive intelligence-collection operations,\u201d the\u00a0Journal\u00a0explains.", "Kaspersky took advantage of the database compiled by its anti-virus products to find out what other systems were infected by the spyware, and discovered it lurking in the computer systems of those three European hotels, and not a single other hotel using Kaspersky software in the world. Two of these hotels were reportedly infected by the virus only a few weeks before negotiations began; the third appears to have been compromised last year, with the extraordinarily stealthy spyware lying dormant for months.", "\u201cKaspersky, in keeping with its policy, doesn\u2019t identify Israel by name as the country responsible for the hacks,\u201d the Journal\u00a0reports. \u201cBut researchers at the company indicate that they suspect an Israeli connection in subtle ways. For example, the company\u2019s report is titled \u2018The Duqu Bet.\u2019 Bet is the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet.\u201d", "Based on their own experience battling the infection in their systems, Kaspersky technicians describe this strain of Duqu as an instrument too sophisticated, expensive, and delicate for rogue hackers to develop and deploy.", "Notably, they are convinced creating this enhanced version of Duqu would have required access to the original source code \u2013 which, in turn, is believed by Kaspersky to share some electronic DNA with the Stuxnet virus, a joint U.S.-Israeli project, as Business Insider\u00a0reports. Chris Weber of Casaba Security is quoted by BI describing Duqu 2.0 as an \u201cextremely advanced malware platform with delivery mechanisms on part with Stuxnet.\u201d Weber went on to more pithily describe the new Duqu strain as \u201cbad-ass.\u201d", "It is not clear exactly what the Duqu spyware did while it was in the hotel systems. \u201cAmong the possibilities, the researchers say, the intruders might have been able to eavesdrop on conversations and steal electronic files by commandeering the hotel systems that connect to computers, phones, elevators and alarms, allowing them to turn them on and off at will to collect information,\u201d the WSJ writes.", "In fact, the virus deposits separate modules to complete these and other tasks, so it is possible that whoever was controlling the software could have done them all. Duqu 2.0 is also good at hiding itself, vacating systems without leaving intrusion footprints, and installing little back doors it can use to return to compromised systems in the future.", "Everyone else involved is very gingerly stepping around the question of where that virus came from.

push malware and viruses to tens of thousands of people over the last five years.

Other posts advertised mobile apps that users could use to join the country\u2019s army. These apps really redirected users to VBScripts, Windows Script Files, and Android apps that contained malicious malware.", "The posts from the fake Haftar account featured multiple misspellings, typos, and grammatical errors which hinted to Check Point that the content of the pages was generated by an Arabic speaker since translation engines that would automatically convert the text from another language would not be likely to introduce the errors observed by researchers.", "The researchers discovered 30 Facebook pages, with some active since early 2014, spreading malicious links across the platform. The top five most popular pages were followed by more than 422,000 other Facebook users. The research firm found that just one link posted by the fake pages received 6,500 clicks, with 5,120 of them coming from Libya.", "Researchers discovered another account by the name \u201cDexter Ly\u201d which made similar typos to the ones found on the other pages. This account openly shared details about the malware campaign and even included screenshots showing the number of devices infected with viruses. The account also appeared to publish sensitive information that seems to have been taken from infected targets, including personal documents of Libyan government officials such as passports, emails, and phone numbers.", "\u201cThese Pages and accounts violated our policies and we took them down after Check Point reported them to us,\u201d Facebook officials said in a statement. \u201cWe are continuing to invest heavily in technology to keep malicious activity off Facebook, and we encourage people to remain vigilant about clicking on suspicious links or downloading untrusted software.\u201d", "Check Point researchers commented on the network stating \u201cAlthough the set of tools which the attacker utilized is not advanced nor impressive per se, the use of tailored content, legitimate websites and highly active pages with many followers made it much easier to potentially infect thousands of victims.

["Health authorities in Brazil are warning couples to delay pregnancies\u00a0as they treat thousands of cases of infant brain damage experts believe could be linked to the rare African Zika virus. Some suggest the virus made its appearance in Brazil through the high influx of tourists following the 2014 World Cup.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that\u2019s what we\u2019re recommending,\u201d Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Pernambuco, told CNN. Officials have recorded over 2,400 cases of microcephaly, a disorder in infants in which the size of the brain is abnormally small, this year; for comparison, doctors recorded only 147 cases of microcephaly in 2014. 29 of the infants diagnosed with microcephaly in 2015 have died.", "Rocha tells CNN that \u201ca generation of babies\u201d is being affected in\u00a0Pernambuco, the hardest-hit region of Brazil. Six states have declared a state of emergency over the matter. One of the infants was found to be carrying the Zika virus in their blood during an autopsy, and a number of the mothers reported symptoms characteristic of carrying the virus.", "According to Brazil\u2019s federal association of Obstetrician/Gynecologists, the symptoms of Zika contamination are \u201clike dengue fever, but less aggressive,\u201d and \u201c70 to 80 percent of patients are asymptomatic.\u201d The\u00a0Wall Street Journal notes that most adults who contract the Zika virus recover in about a week through \u201cbed rest and liquids,\u201d and symptoms include\u00a0\u201cfever, rashes, headaches, joint aches and vomiting.\u201d", "The similarities to diseases like dengue could lead to a number of patients not being recorded, receiving treatment for dengue fever instead and recovering. CNN notes the similarities in the symptoms are no coincidence: Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya virus are all the product of interactions with\u00a0Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito.\u00a0Aedes aegypti lives in the southern areas of the United States, particularly Texas, where the crippling Chikungunya virus has been found.", "Zika virus, CNN notes, first surfaced in Uganda more than half a century ago, but was only identified in Brazil in early 2015, leading to the conclusion that tourists visiting for the 2014 World Cup were responsible for carrying it into a new continent. In addition to appearing in one of the infants diagnosed with microcephaly, Brazilian newspaper\u00a0O Globo reports\u00a0of an adult case of Zika being transmitted through a blood transfusion in Sao Paolo state. Brazilian hospitals screen blood donors for major diseases, like various forms of hepatitis and HIV, but have no way of testing for Zika. Officials confirmed with the newspaper that \u201cthere is not currently a commercial test to identify the virus commercially available for use on a large scale.\u201d This leaves open the possibility that a pregnant woman could receive the virus through a blood transfusion should she need one during the course of the pregnancy.", "Due to the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon,\u00a0O Globo warns that 2016 could bring the \u201csummer of Zika.\u201d Temperatures are expected to be milder and more humid, which meteorologist Francisco de Assis Diniz described as \u201cmusic to a mosquito\u2019s ears.\u201d", "Brazilians have taken the matter into their own hands, seeking more information on the virus.\u00a0Matheus Piz\u00e3o and Tatiana Viana, an expecting couple, have started the Twitter hashtag #SemZika (\u201cwithout Zika\u201d) to use as a resource for sharing information about identifying and avoiding Zika. \u201cTatiana and I waited ten years to have our first child and we were horrified,\u201d\u00a0Piz\u00e3o explains to the newspaper. \u201cWe doubled our precautions.
