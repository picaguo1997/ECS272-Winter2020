For any individual, that risk is still relatively small, although it's worth noting such estimates are averages - just like flu, the risks fall more heavily on the elderly and already infirm.", "But China's experience of this epidemic demonstrates two things. Firstly, it offers a terrifying glimpse of the potential effect on a healthcare system when you scale up infections of this kind of virus across massive populations.

By late December, medical staff in Wuhan were beginning to notice unusual symptoms of viral pneumonia, with a cluster linked to the market trading in illegal wildlife. On 30 December, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan's Central Hospital, posted his concerns in a private medical chat group, advising colleagues to take measures to protect themselves. He'd seen seven patients who appeared to be suffering with an illness similar to Sars - another coronavirus that began in an illegal Chinese wildlife market in 2002 and went on to kill 774 people worldwide.", "A few days later, he was summoned by the police.", "Dr Li was made to sign a confession, denouncing the messages he'd posted as \"illegal behaviour\".", "The case received national media attention, with a high-profile state-run TV report announcing that in total, eight people in Wuhan were being investigated for \"spreading rumours\".

The day after Dr Li posted his message, China notified the World Health Organization, and the day after that, the suspected source - the market - was closed down.", "But despite the multiplying cases and the concerns among medics that human-to-human transmission was taking place, the authorities did little to protect the public. Doctors were already setting up quarantine rooms and anticipating extra admissions when Wuhan held its important annual political gathering, the city's People's Congress.", "In their speeches, the Communist Party leaders made no mention of the virus. China's National Health Commission continued to report that the number of infections was limited and that there was no clear evidence that the disease could spread between humans.", "And on 18 January the Wuhan authorities allowed a massive community banquet to take place, involving more than 40,000 families. The aim was to set a record for the most dishes served at an event. Two days later, China finally confirmed that human-to-human transmission was indeed taking place.", "Most remarkable of all perhaps, the following day, Wuhan held a Lunar New Year dance performance, attended by senior officials from across the surrounding province of Hubei.

The wars, famines and diseases that shook the dynasties of old have given them their inheritance; an acute historical sense of the danger of the unforeseen crisis. They will also know well what Chernobyl did for the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party in the former USSR.", "\"It's impossible to know if Li Wenliang's death will serve as the catalyst for something bigger,\" Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, tells me. \"But the raw emotion that surged when news of his condition broke indicates deep levels of frustration and anger exist within the country.\"", "Precisely because it feels the weight of history, however, the Communist Party has made holding onto power a living obsession, and it has an ever more formidable domestic security apparatus to help it to do so. Over the past few decades it has proven nothing if not resilient, enduring through political chaos, devastating earthquakes and man-made disasters.", "But one sign that might hint at an awareness of just how great the current risks are comes in the role being played by China's President Xi Jinping. This week - for the first time since the crisis began - he ventured out to meet health workers involved in the fight, visiting a hospital and a virus control centre in Beijing.", "In contrast, his premier, Li Keqiang, has been sent to the front lines in Wuhan and appointed head of a special working group to tackle the epidemic.

Eventually an infected animal is captured, and a person somehow catches the disease, then passes it on to workers at a wildlife market. A global outbreak is born. ", "Scientists are attempting to prove the truth of this scenario as they work to find wild animals harbouring the virus. Finding the sequence of events is \"a bit of a detective story\", says Prof Andrew Cunningham of Zoological Society London (ZSL). A range of wild animal species could be the host, he says, in particular bats, which harbour a large number of different coronaviruses.", "So how much do we know about the \"spillover event\", as it's known in the trade? When scientists cracked the code of the new virus, taken from the body of a patient, bats in China were implicated.", "The mammals gather in large colonies, fly long distances and are present on every continent. They rarely get sick themselves, but have the opportunity to spread pathogens far and wide. According to Prof Kate Jones of University College London, there is some evidence bats have adapted to the energetic demands of flight and are better at repairing DNA damage. \"This might enable them to cope with a higher burden of viruses before getting sick - but this is just an idea at present.\" ", "There's no doubt that the behaviour of bats allows viruses to thrive. \"When you consider the very way that they live, then they are going to have a large array of viruses,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball from the University of Nottingham. \"And because they're mammals there's a possibility that some of them can infect humans either directly or through an intermediate host species.\"", "The second part of the puzzle, then, is the identity of the mystery animal that incubated the virus in its body and possibly ended up in the market at Wuhan. One suspect for the smoking gun is the pangolin. ", "The ant-devouring scaly mammal, said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world, is threatened with extinction. The animal's scales are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine, while pangolin meat is considered a delicacy by some. ", "Coronaviruses have been found in pangolins, some claimed to be a close match to the novel human virus. Could the bat virus and pangolin virus have traded genetics before spreading to humans? Experts are cautious about drawing any conclusions. Full data on the pangolin study has not been released, making the information impossible to verify.", "Prof Cunningham says the provenance and number of pangolins examined for the research is especially important. \"For example, were there multiple animals sampled directly in the wild (in which case the results would be more meaningful), or was a single animal from a captive environment or wet market sampled (in which case conclusions about the true host of the virus could not be robustly made)?\"", "Pangolins and other wild species, including a variety of species of bat, are often sold in wet markets, he says, providing opportunities for viruses to move from one species to another. \"Wet markets, therefore, create ideal conditions for the spillover of pathogens from one species to another, including to people.\"", "The market in Wuhan, which was closed down after the outbreak, had a wild animal section, where live and slaughtered species were on sale, including body parts of camels, koalas and birds.  The Guardian reports that an inventory at one shop listed live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions, bamboo rats, squirrels, foxes, civets, hedgehogs (probably porcupines), salamanders, turtles and crocodiles.", "As far as we know, bats and pangolins weren't listed, but authorities in China will have intelligence on what animals were being sold, says Prof Ball. \"If the spillover's happened once, you want to know whether or not this sort of thing can happen again, because it's important from a public health standpoint,\" he says. \"And so you need to know exactly what species of animal it's in and also what were the risks that gave rise to that spillover event.\"", "Many of the viruses we have become familiar with in recent years have crossed over from wild animals. This is the story of Ebola, HIV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and now coronavirus. Prof Jones says the rise in infectious disease events from wildlife might be because of our increasing ability to detect them, growing connectivity to each other, or more encroachment into wild habitats, thereby \"changing landscapes and coming into contact with new viruses the human population hasn't seen before\".", "If we understand the risk factors, we can take steps to prevent it happening in the first place without adversely affecting wild animals, says Prof Cunningham.  Conservationists are at pains to point out that although bats are thought to carry many viruses, they are also essential for ecosystems to function. \"Insectivorous bats eat huge volumes of insects such as mosquitoes and agricultural pests, while fruit bats pollinate trees and spread their seeds,\" he says. \"It is imperative that these species are not culled through misguided 'disease control' measures.\"", "After Sars in 2002-3, caused by a very similar coronavirus to the one now emerging in China and beyond, there was a temporary ban on wild animal markets.

It has been estimated that over 1,700 Chinese healthcare workers have been infected, including six who died.\u00a0Included among the reasons for the high rates of infection among this group is a shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE), but also because some SARS-2 patients present without classic symptoms of a respiratory virus infection, such as cough or shortness of breath. For example, it was just reported in the Journal of the American Association\u00a0(JAMA) that at least 10 health care workers at a university hospital in Wuhan were infected after coming into contact with a patient who was admitted to the surgical ward and presented with abdominal symptoms.

Back when measles occurred regularly in the U.S., it often peaked in late winter and early spring. We simply cannot ask our healthcare workers and state and local public health agencies to fight a triple epidemic of SARS-2, measles, and influenza over the coming weeks. It is therefore imperative that Americans get their families vaccinated against flu and measles.", "State and local health agencies\u00a0", "If SARS-2 transmission becomes significant, many Americans believe the CDC will lead our nation\u2019s response locally. The truth is that the CDC typically takes on an important advisory role, so that it would most likely fall to state and local public health departments to respond and manage these outbreaks. We have some outstanding state, county, city and local health departments, for instance our Harris County and Houston city health departments where I live and work. But we learned during the 2016 Zika outbreaks in Texas and Florida, that there can be tremendous variability in the staffing and expertise among different county and local health departments.

I\u2019ve met DHHS Secretary Azar previously and find him to be smart, committed and pragmatic. He has assembled an outstanding team of top public health physicians, including Drs. Robert Redfield and Nancy Messonnier at CDC. Previously, I also worked closely with Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir when he led then-Governor Perry\u2019s infectious disease task force to combat Ebola virus infection after it appeared in Dallas, Texas. And of course, Dr. Anthony Fauci is still at the helm at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The point is that this is an \u201cA-team\u201d and Americans should feel very good about its ability to respond to SARS-2. However, we have also seen how serious and widespread epidemics can sometimes require the help of agencies outside of the health sector. The most obvious example occurred in 2014 when Ebola virus infection was decimating the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leon. We ultimately needed to send in the 101st Army Airborne Division\u00a0-- the \u201cScreaming Eagles\u201d -- to lead Operation United Assistance in order to provide a working health system to administer care and treatment. In addition, Ron Klain was appointed as \u201cEbola Czar\u201d because of the complexity of our Ebola response, which involved numerous agencies of the federal government. He did an excellent job, and if SARS-2 becomes a significant public health threat in the U.S., our nation may require a similar coordinator to navigate activities across multiple federal agencies.", "New Technologies", "Finally, we are going to require improved biotechnologies to fight this epidemic. One of the problems faced by Chinese physicians was the lack of a sensitive and point-of-care diagnostic that could detect this virus in the early course of a patient\u2019s illness. We\u2019ll need such a diagnostic in order to give our nation\u2019s healthcare workers the best chance to make good decisions on which patients require isolation during clinic visits or visits to hospital emergency rooms. We\u2019ll need new antiviral drugs for severely ill patients, and we\u2019ll need preventive vaccines, such as the ones we\u2019re developing through support from the NIAID, NIH and other agencies. Through both the NIH and the creation of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), we have a running start on shaping these technologies.

Yet another is being put together at facilities in San Diego and Houston, with projections that it could be tested in people by summer.", "To scientists, the work to create a vaccine against the new coronavirus is advancing with a speed they could barely have imagined a decade ago. At the same time, it\u2019s not even close to quick enough to contain the spreading infection \u2014 and in many ways, the outbreak will test the capacity of science to react in real time to a new and unknown \u201cpathogen X\u201d that takes the world by surprise.", "\u201cTraditional vaccine development efforts have usually taken decades, not months,\u201d said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, which hopes to have a vaccine in human testing by April. \u201cThis is, first, a response to this new virus, but it\u2019s also a drill for pathogen X \u2026 [to] press the system, to see how rapidly we can go.\u201d", "When a mysterious new illness emerges and public alarm is at its peak, there\u2019s a race to develop a way to prevent or treat the disease.

Eight years ago, he and his co-director, Maria Elena Bottazzi, won federal funding to create a vaccine against SARS, a coronavirus that emerged in 2002 and infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. By 2016, they had manufactured enough of the potential vaccine to get through toxicology tests and human safety trials.", "But the team tried and failed to win various grants to bring their experimental vaccine through further testing. They say about $2 million could have funded essential and time-consuming toxicology studies and ready it for phase 1 trials \u2014 the technical term for the first-in-humans studies that typically determine the dosing and safety of a drug. Although the threat of SARS has receded, it was becoming increasingly clear that coronaviruses, long thought to cause mild illness, were able to cause serious pandemics.", "When the new coronavirus genome sequence was posted to an online genetic databank in early January, Hotez immediately saw the close similarity to SARS and realized the samples sitting in storage had the potential to defend against the new virus.", "\u201cHad we been able to secure the investment, we could have done all the phase 1 trials. We could have potentially been ready to vaccinate in China, now,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cThis is the problem with the whole vaccine infrastructure \u2014 it\u2019s reactive, not anticipatory enough. \u2018Oh, SARS is gone now, let\u2019s move on.\u2019\u201d", "Scientists are unraveling the Chinese coronavirus with unprecedented speed and openness", "What the scientific response to the new coronavirus has shown so far is how the first step in the process \u2014 designing and even beginning to manufacture the vaccine \u2014 can happen nearly overnight, thanks to the emergence of new technologies.", "Scientists at the National Institutes of Health were strategizing with a Massachusetts biotech company, Moderna, over the winter holiday break about collaborating to build a vaccine for the virus. As soon as the genome of the virus was posted online, NIH designed the piece of the vaccine that should trigger the immune system to recognize and disable the virus. NIH sent its design to Moderna, which could integrate it into its virus platform and rapidly scale up manufacturing. NIH hopes to have the vaccine in the first safety trials by April.", "At Inovio, a biotech company headquartered outside Philadelphia, a team began working on designing a vaccine hours after the sequence appeared, Shea said. The company farmed out production of one piece of its vaccine to a contract laboratory in Houston and is making the other component at its facility in San Diego. The company is gearing up for the lab and animal tests that will be necessary before safety trials in people.", "Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has also jumped into the vaccine effort and estimates it will be eight to 12 months before its candidate is ready for testing in people. Many countries are also working on different approaches, in parallel.", "\u201cThe actual technical feat of making a vaccine against this virus is probably not going to be that hard,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cThe problem is you can\u2019t avoid or even compress the timelines very much for safety testing.\u201d", "That means scientists are flooded with public interest in their vaccine efforts right now and must temper their excitement with the reality that there will be a months-long wait, at minimum, for a vaccine that\u2019s ready for its first tests in people.", "\u201cWhat is the value of a vaccine if development takes a year in the context of the current situation, which seems to be moving very rapidly? The value of a vaccine is we don\u2019t actually know what the trajectory of the epidemic could be,\u201d said Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global alliance that is funding the Inovio and Moderna efforts and another vaccine being created by researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia.", "For example, if the outbreak is still raging after initial safety tests, it is possible experimental vaccines could be used to protect people on the front lines of treating the disease or in emergency situations before they are approved for the general population, as happened with Ebola. When Ebola devastated West Africa in 2014, a vaccine was not ready. But when the virus resurfaced in 2019 in Congo, more than 200,000 people were vaccinated.", "If the infections have begun to subside by the time vaccines are through the first round of safety testing, getting a vaccine approved would still be useful in case the virus flares again \u2014 but showing it is safe for healthy people in the general population will take time and continued effort.", "In the meantime, researchers are also looking at ways of quickly repurposing existing antiviral drugs to see whether any might work against the coronavirus. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson, said the company has donated 100 boxes of an HIV medication, Prezcobix, to clinicians in Shanghai to see whether it showed any efficacy against the illness. Purdue University researchers hope to test experimental drugs that were initially developed to fight SARS. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, researchers have been gearing up to test remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug that has shown promise against other coronaviruses but failed against Ebola.", "But every step takes time. Even having the right laboratory tests, ingredients and animal models of the disease are crucial and time-consuming steps. Laboratories have been waiting for the viral genome to be synthesized by companies and are anxious to get samples of the actual virus.", "A decade after SARS, another coronavirus emerged that caused Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Many say the coronavirus in China is a lesson that this family of viruses will continue to cross from animals into humans and cause potential pandemics. That means scientists would like to be prepared, with vaccine platforms that can be readily adapted to new infections and antiviral drugs that work broadly for multiple diseases.", "\u201cEmerging viruses, they\u2019re a moving target. They come, and they go, and sometimes they come and they don\u2019t go. But it\u2019s impossible to predict the trajectory of an emerging virus,\u201d said Timothy Sheahan, assistant professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina. \u201cSo one way we\u2019re trying to maximize the utility of a given antiviral drug is to develop broad-spectrum antivirals.
